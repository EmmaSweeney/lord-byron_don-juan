			<h3>I.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I now mean to be serious;—it is time,</p>
					<p class="i2">Since Laughter now-a-days is deemed too serious;</p>
					<p>A jest at Vice by Virtue's called a crime,</p>
					<p class="i2">And critically held as deleterious:</p>
					<p>Besides, the sad's a source of the sublime,</p>
					<p class="i2">Although, when long, a little apt to weary us;</p>
					<p>And therefore shall my lay soar high and solemn,</p>
					<p>As an old temple dwindled to a column.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>II.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The Lady Adeline Amundeville</p>
					<p class="i2">('T is an old Norman name, and to be found</p>
					<p>In pedigrees, by those who wander still</p>
					<p class="i2">Along the last fields of that Gothic ground)</p>
					<p>Was high-born, wealthy by her father's will,</p>
					<p class="i2">And beauteous, even where beauties most abound,</p>
					<p>In Britain—which, of course, true patriots find</p>
					<p>The goodliest soil of Body and of Mind.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>III.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I'll not gainsay them; it is not my cue;</p>
					<p class="i2">I'll leave them to their taste, no doubt the best;</p>
					<p>An eye's an eye, and whether black or blue,</p>
					<p class="i2">Is no great matter, so 't is in request;</p>
					<p>'T is nonsense to dispute about a hue—</p>
					<p class="i2">The kindest may be taken as a test.</p>
					<p>The fair sex should be always fair; and no man,</p>
					<p>Till thirty, should perceive there's a plain woman.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And after that serene and somewhat dull</p>
					<p class="i2">Epoch, that awkward corner turned for days</p>
					<p>More quiet, when our moon's no more at full,</p>
					<p class="i2">We may presume to criticise or praise;</p>
					<p>Because Indifference begins to lull</p>
					<p class="i2">Our passions, and we walk in Wisdom's ways;</p>
					<p>Also because the figure and the face</p>
					<p>Hint, that 't is time to give the younger place.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>V.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I know that some would fain postpone this era,</p>
					<p class="i2">Reluctant as all placemen to resign</p>
					<p>Their post; but theirs is merely a chimera,</p>
					<p class="i2">For they have passed Life's equinoctial line:</p>
					<p>But then they have their claret and Madeira,</p>
					<p class="i2">To irrigate the dryness of decline;</p>
					<p>And County meetings, and the Parliament,</p>
					<p>And debt—and what not, for their solace sent.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And is there not Religion, and Reform,</p>
					<p class="i2">Peace, War, the taxes, and what's called the "Nation"?</p>
					<p>The struggle to be pilots in a storm?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_654">[654]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">The landed and the monied speculation?</p>
					<p>The joys of mutual hate to keep them warm,</p>
					<p class="i2">Instead of Love, that mere hallucination?</p>
					<p>Now Hatred is by far the longest pleasure;</p>
					<p>Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Rough Johnson, the great moralist, professed,</p>
					<p class="i2">Right honestly, "he liked an honest hater!"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_655">[655]</a>—</p>
					<p>The only truth that yet has been confessed</p>
					<p class="i2">Within these latest thousand years or later.</p>
					<p>Perhaps the fine old fellow spoke in jest:—</p>
					<p class="i2">For my part, I am but a mere spectator,</p>
					<p>And gaze where'er the palace or the hovel is,</p>
					<p>Much in the mode of Goethe's Mephistopheles;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But neither love nor hate in much excess;</p>
					<p class="i2">Though 't was not once so. If I sneer sometimes,</p>
					<p>It is because I cannot well do less,</p>
					<p class="i2">And now and then it also suits my rhymes.</p>
					<p>I should be very willing to redress</p>
					<p class="i2">Men's wrongs, and rather check than punish crimes,</p>
					<p>Had not Cervantes, in that too true tale</p>
					<p>Of Quixote, shown how all such efforts fail.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IX.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_656">[656]</a></h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Of all tales 't is the saddest—and more sad,</p>
					<p class="i2">Because it makes us smile: his hero's right,</p>
					<p>And still pursues the right;—to curb the bad</p>
					<p class="i2">His only object, and 'gainst odds to fight</p>
					<p>His guerdon: 't is his virtue makes him mad!</p>
					<p class="i2">But his adventures form a sorry sight;—</p>
					<p>A sorrier still is the great moral taught</p>
					<p>By that real Epic unto all who have thought.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_LX">[LX]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>X.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Redressing injury, revenging wrong,</p>
					<p class="i2">To aid the damsel and destroy the caitiff;</p>
					<p>Opposing singly the united strong,</p>
					<p class="i2">From foreign yoke to free the helpless native:—</p>
					<p>Alas! must noblest views, like an old song,</p>
					<p class="i2">Be for mere Fancy's sport a theme creative,</p>
					<p>A jest, a riddle, Fame through thin and thick sought!</p>
					<p>And Socrates himself but Wisdom's Quixote?</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away;</p>
					<p class="i2">A single laugh demolished the right arm</p>
					<p>Of his own country;—seldom since that day</p>
					<p class="i2">Has Spain had heroes. While Romance could charm,</p>
					<p>The World gave ground before her bright array;</p>
					<p class="i2">And therefore have his volumes done such harm,</p>
					<p>That all their glory, as a composition,</p>
					<p>Was dearly purchased by his land's perdition.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I'm "at my old lunes"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_657">[657]</a>—digression, and forget</p>
					<p class="i2">The Lady Adeline Amundeville;</p>
					<p>The fair most fatal Juan ever met,</p>
					<p class="i2">Although she was not evil nor meant ill;</p>
					<p>But Destiny and Passion spread the net</p>
					<p class="i2">(Fate is a good excuse for our own will),</p>
					<p>And caught them;—what do they <i>not</i> catch, methinks?</p>
					<p>But I'm not Oedipus, and Life's a Sphinx.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I tell the tale as it is told, nor dare</p>
					<p class="i2">To venture a solution: "<i>Davus sum!</i>"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_658">[658]</a></p>
					<p>And now I will proceed upon the pair.</p>
					<p class="i2">Sweet Adeline, amidst the gay World's hum,</p>
					<p>Was the Queen-Bee, the glass of all that's fair;</p>
					<p class="i2">Whose charms made all men speak, and women dumb.</p>
					<p>The last's a miracle, and such was reckoned,</p>
					<p>And since that time there has not been a second.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Chaste was she, to Detraction's desperation,</p>
					<p class="i2">And wedded unto one she had loved well—</p>
					<p>A man known in the councils of the Nation,</p>
					<p class="i2">Cool, and quite English, imperturbable,</p>
					<p>Though apt to act with fire upon occasion,</p>
					<p class="i2">Proud of himself and her: the World could tell</p>
					<p>Nought against either, and both seemed secure—</p>
					<p>She in her virtue, he in his hauteur.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>It chanced some diplomatical relations,</p>
					<p class="i2">Arising out of business, often brought</p>
					<p>Himself and Juan in their mutual stations</p>
					<p class="i2">Into close contact. Though reserved, nor caught</p>
					<p>By specious seeming, Juan's youth, and patience,</p>
					<p class="i2">And talent, on his haughty spirit wrought,</p>
					<p>And formed a basis of esteem, which ends</p>
					<p>In making men what Courtesy calls friends.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And thus Lord Henry, who was cautious as</p>
					<p class="i2">Reserve and Pride could make him, and full slow</p>
					<p>In judging men—when once his judgment was</p>
					<p class="i2">Determined, right or wrong, on friend or foe,</p>
					<p>Had all the pertinacity Pride has,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which knows no ebb to its imperious flow,</p>
					<p>And loves or hates, disdaining to be guided,</p>
					<p>Because its own good pleasure hath decided.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>His friendships, therefore, and no less aversions,</p>
					<p class="i2">Though oft well founded, which confirmed but more</p>
					<p>His prepossessions, like the laws of Persians</p>
					<p class="i2">And Medes, would ne'er revoke what went before.</p>
					<p>His feelings had not those strange fits, like tertians,</p>
					<p class="i2">Of common likings, which make some deplore</p>
					<p>What they should laugh at—the mere ague still</p>
					<p>Of men's regard, the fever or the chill.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"'T is not in mortals to command success:"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_659">[659]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">But <i>do you more</i>, Sempronius—<i>don't</i> deserve it,</p>
					<p>And take my word, you won't have any less.</p>
					<p class="i2">Be wary, watch the time, and always serve it;</p>
					<p>Give gently way, when there's too great a press;</p>
					<p class="i2">And for your conscience, only learn to nerve it;</p>
					<p>For, like a racer, or a boxer training,</p>
					<p>'T will make, if proved, vast efforts without paining.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Lord Henry also liked to be superior,</p>
					<p class="i2">As most men do, the little or the great;</p>
					<p>The very lowest find out an inferior,</p>
					<p class="i2">At least they think so, to exert their state</p>
					<p>Upon: for there are very few things wearier</p>
					<p class="i2">Than solitary Pride's oppressive weight,</p>
					<p>Which mortals generously would divide,</p>
					<p>By bidding others carry while they ride.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>In birth, in rank, in fortune likewise equal,</p>
					<p class="i2">O'er Juan he could no distinction claim;</p>
					<p>In years he had the advantage of Time's sequel;</p>
					<p class="i2">And, as he thought, in country much the same—</p>
					<p>Because bold Britons have a tongue and free quill,</p>
					<p class="i2">At which all modern nations vainly aim;</p>
					<p>And the Lord Henry was a great debater,</p>
					<p>So that few Members kept the House up later.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>These were advantages: and then he thought—</p>
					<p class="i2">It was his foible, but by no means sinister—</p>
					<p>That few or none more than himself had caught</p>
					<p class="i2">Court mysteries, having been himself a minister:</p>
					<p>He liked to teach that which he had been taught,</p>
					<p class="i2">And greatly shone whenever there had been a stir;</p>
					<p>And reconciled all qualities which grace man,</p>
					<p>Always a patriot—and, sometimes, a placeman.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>He liked the gentle Spaniard for his gravity;</p>
					<p class="i2">He almost honoured him for his docility;</p>
					<p>Because, though young, he acquiesced with suavity,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or contradicted but with proud humility.</p>
					<p>He knew the World, and would not see depravity</p>
					<p class="i2">In faults which sometimes show the soil's fertility,</p>
					<p>If that the weeds o'erlive not the first crop—</p>
					<p>For then they are very difficult to stop.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And then he talked with him about Madrid,</p>
					<p class="i2">Constantinople, and such distant places;</p>
					<p>Where people always did as they were bid,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or did what they should not with foreign graces.</p>
					<p>Of coursers also spake they: Henry rid</p>
					<p class="i2">Well, like most Englishmen, and loved the races;</p>
					<p>And Juan, like a true-born Andalusian,</p>
					<p>Could back<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_660">[660]</a> a horse, as Despots ride a Russian.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And thus acquaintance grew, at noble routs,</p>
					<p class="i2">And diplomatic dinners, or at other—</p>
					<p>For Juan stood well both with Ins and Outs,</p>
					<p class="i2">As in freemasonry a higher brother.</p>
					<p>Upon his talent Henry had no doubts;</p>
					<p class="i2">His manner showed him sprung from a high mother,</p>
					<p>And all men like to show their hospitality</p>
					<p>To him whose breeding matches with his quality.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>At Blank-Blank Square;—for we will break no squares<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_661">[661]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">By naming streets: since men are so censorious,</p>
					<p>And apt to sow an author's wheat with tares,</p>
					<p class="i2">Reaping allusions private and inglorious,</p>
					<p>Where none were dreamt of, unto Love's affairs,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which were, or are, or are to be notorious,</p>
					<p>That therefore do I previously declare,</p>
					<p>Lord Henry's mansion was in Blank-Blank Square.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Also there bin<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_662">[662]</a> another pious reason</p>
					<p class="i2">For making squares and streets anonymous;</p>
					<p>Which is, that there is scarce a single season</p>
					<p class="i2">Which doth not shake some very splendid house</p>
					<p>With some slight heart-quake of domestic treason—</p>
					<p class="i2">A topic Scandal doth delight to rouse:</p>
					<p>Such I might stumble over unawares,</p>
					<p>Unless I knew the very chastest squares.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>'T is true, I might have chosen Piccadilly,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_663">[663]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">A place where peccadillos are unknown;</p>
					<p>But I have motives, whether wise or silly,</p>
					<p class="i2">For letting that pure sanctuary alone.</p>
					<p>Therefore I name not square, street, place, until I</p>
					<p class="i2">Find one where nothing naughty can be shown,</p>
					<p>A vestal shrine of Innocence of Heart:</p>
					<p>Such are—but I have lost the London Chart.</p>

			</div>
			<h3>XXVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>At Henry's mansion then, in Blank-Blank Square,</p>
					<p class="i2">Was Juan a <i>recherché</i>, welcome guest,</p>
					<p>As many other noble scions were;</p>
					<p class="i2">And some who had but Talent for their crest;</p>
					<p>Or Wealth, which is a passport everywhere;</p>
					<p class="i2">Or even mere Fashion, which indeed's the best</p>
					<p>Recommendation; and to be well dressed</p>
					<p>Will very often supersede the rest.</p>

			<h3>XXIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And since "there's safety in a multitude</p>
					<p class="i2">Of counsellors," as Solomon has said,</p>
					<p>Or some one for him, in some sage, grave mood;—</p>
					<p class="i2">Indeed we see the daily proof displayed</p>
					<p>In Senates, at the Bar, in wordy feud,</p>
					<p class="i2">Where'er collective wisdom can parade,</p>
					<p>Which is the only cause that we can guess</p>

					<p class="i2">Her chief resource was in her own high spirit,</p>
					<p>Which judged Mankind at their due estimation;</p>

					<p class="i2">A gentle, genial courtesy of mind,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_LZ">[LZ]</a></p>
