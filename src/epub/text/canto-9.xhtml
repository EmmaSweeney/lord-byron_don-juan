					<p>Death laughs—Go ponder o'er the skeleton</p>

					<p>It <i>laughs not</i>—there is now no fleshy bar</p>

					<p>But still he <i>smiles</i>; and whether near or far,</p>
					<p class="i2">He strips from man that mantle (far more dear</p>

			<h3>XIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And thus Death laughs,—it is sad merriment,</p>
					<p class="i2">But still it <i>is</i> so; and with such example</p>
					<p>Why should not Life be equally content</p>
					<p class="i2">With his Superior, in a smile to trample</p>
					<p>Upon the nothings which are daily spent</p>
					<p class="i2">Like bubbles on an Ocean much less ample</p>

					<p>I am neither Alexander nor Hephæstion,</p>

			<h3>XV.</h3>

					<p>For the great benefit of those who know</p>
					<p class="i2">What indigestion is—that inward fate</p>
					<p>Which makes all Styx through one small liver flow.</p>
					<p class="i2">A peasant's sweat is worth his lord's estate:</p>

				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"To be, or not to be?"—Ere I decide,</p>

					<p>'T is true we speculate both far and wide,</p>

					<p>For my part, I'll enlist on neither side,</p>
					<p class="i2">Until I see both sides for once agreeing.</p>
					<p>For me, I sometimes think that Life is Death,</p>
					<p>Rather than Life a mere affair of breath.</p>

			<h3>XVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p><i>"Que scais-je"</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_489">[489]</a> was the motto of Montaigne,</p>
					<p class="i2">As also of the first academicians:</p>
					<p>That all is dubious which man may attain,</p>
					<p class="i2">Was one of their most favourite positions.</p>
					<p>There's no such thing as certainty, that's plain</p>
					<p class="i2">As any of Mortality's conditions;</p>
					<p>So little do we know what we're about in</p>
					<p>This world, I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.</p>

			<h3>XVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>It is a pleasant voyage perhaps to float,</p>
					<p class="i2">Like Pyrrho,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_490">[490]</a> on a sea of speculation;</p>
					<p>But what if carrying sail capsize the boat?</p>
					<p class="i2">Your wise men don't know much of navigation;</p>
					<p>And swimming long in the abyss of thought</p>
					<p class="i2">Is apt to tire: a calm and shallow station</p>
					<p>Well nigh the shore, where one stoops down and gathers</p>
					<p>Some pretty shell, is best for moderate bathers.</p>

			<h3>XIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"But Heaven," as Cassio says, "is above all—<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_491">[491]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">No more of this, then, let us pray!" We have</p>
					<p>Souls to save, since Eve's slip and Adam's fall,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which tumbled all mankind into the grave,</p>
					<p>Besides fish, beasts, and birds. "The sparrow's fall</p>
					<p class="i2">Is special providence,"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_492">[492]</a> though how <i>it</i> gave</p>
					<p>Offence, we know not; probably it perched</p>
					<p>Upon the tree which Eve so fondly searched.</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Oh! ye immortal Gods! what is Theogony?</p>

					<p class="i2">Some people have accused me of Misanthropy;</p>
