			<h3>I.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Bob Southey! You're a poet—Poet-laureate,</p>
					<p class="i2">And representative of all the race;</p>
					<p>Although 't is true that you turned out a Tory at</p>
					<p class="i2">Last,—yours has lately been a common case;</p>
					<p>And now, my Epic Renegade! what are ye at?</p>
					<p class="i2">With all the Lakers, in and out of place?</p>
					<p>A nest of tuneful persons, to my eye</p>
					<p>Like "four and twenty Blackbirds in a pye;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>II.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"Which pye being opened they began to sing,"</p>
					<p class="i2">(This old song and new simile holds good),</p>
					<p>"A dainty dish to set before the King,"</p>
					<p class="i2">Or Regent, who admires such kind of food;—</p>
					<p>And Coleridge, too, has lately taken wing,</p>
					<p class="i2">But like a hawk encumbered with his hood,—</p>
					<p>Explaining Metaphysics to the nation—</p>
					<p>I wish he would explain his Explanation.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2">[2]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>III.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>You, Bob! are rather insolent, you know,</p>
					<p class="i2">At being disappointed in your wish</p>
					<p>To supersede all warblers here below,</p>
					<p class="i2">And be the only Blackbird in the dish;</p>
					<p>And then you overstrain yourself, or so,</p>
					<p class="i2">And tumble downward like the flying fish</p>
					<p>Gasping on deck, because you soar too high, Bob,</p>
					<p>And fall, for lack of moisture, quite a-dry, Bob!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3">[3]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And Wordsworth, in a rather long "Excursion,"</p>
					<p class="i2">(I think the quarto holds five hundred pages),</p>
					<p>Has given a sample from the vasty version</p>
					<p class="i2">Of his new system<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4">[4]</a> to perplex the sages;</p>
					<p>'T is poetry-at least by his assertion,</p>
					<p class="i2">And may appear so when the dog-star rages—</p>
					<p>And he who understands it would be able</p>
					<p>To add a story to the Tower of Babel.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>V.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>You—Gentlemen! by dint of long seclusion</p>
					<p class="i2">From better company, have kept your own</p>
					<p>At Keswick, and, through still continued fusion</p>
					<p class="i2">Of one another's minds, at last have grown</p>
					<p>To deem as a most logical conclusion,</p>
					<p class="i2">That Poesy has wreaths for you alone:</p>
					<p>There is a narrowness in such a notion,</p>
					<p>Which makes me wish you'd change your lakes for Ocean.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I would not imitate the petty thought,</p>
					<p class="i2">Nor coin my self-love to so base a vice,</p>
					<p>For all the glory your conversion brought,</p>
					<p class="i2">Since gold alone should not have been its price.</p>
					<p>You have your salary; was 't for that you wrought?</p>
					<p class="i2">And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5">[5]</a></p>
					<p>You're shabby fellows—true—but poets still,</p>
					<p>And duly seated on the Immortal Hill.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Your bays may hide the baldness of your brows—</p>
					<p class="i2">Perhaps some virtuous blushes;—let them go—</p>
					<p>To you I envy neither fruit nor boughs—</p>
					<p class="i2">And for the fame you would engross below,</p>
					<p>The field is universal, and allows</p>
					<p class="i2">Scope to all such as feel the inherent glow:</p>
					<p>Scott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe, will try</p>
					<p>'Gainst you the question with posterity.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>For me, who, wandering with pedestrian Muses,</p>
					<p class="i2">Contend not with you on the wingéd steed,</p>
					<p>I wish your fate may yield ye, when she chooses,</p>
					<p class="i2">The fame you envy, and the skill you need;</p>
					<p>And, recollect, a poet nothing loses</p>
					<p class="i2">In giving to his brethren their full meed</p>
					<p>Of merit—and complaint of present days</p>
					<p>Is not the certain path to future praise.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>He that reserves his laurels for posterity</p>
					<p class="i2">(Who does not often claim the bright reversion)</p>
					<p>Has generally no great crop to spare it, he</p>
					<p class="i2">Being only injured by his own assertion;</p>
					<p>And although here and there some glorious rarity</p>
					<p class="i2">Arise like Titan from the sea's immersion,</p>
					<p>The major part of such appellants go</p>
					<p>To—God knows where—for no one else can know.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>X.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>If, fallen in evil days on evil tongues,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6">[6]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Milton appealed to the Avenger, Time,</p>
					<p>If Time, the Avenger, execrates his wrongs,</p>
					<p class="i2">And makes the word "Miltonic" mean "<i>Sublime</i>,"</p>
					<p><i>He</i> deigned not to belie his soul in songs,</p>
					<p class="i2">Nor turn his very talent to a crime;</p>
					<p><i>He</i> did not loathe the Sire to laud the Son,</p>
					<p>But closed the tyrant-hater he begun.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Think'st thou, could he—the blind Old Man—arise</p>
					<p class="i2">Like Samuel from the grave, to freeze once more</p>
					<p>The blood of monarchs with his prophecies,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or be alive again—again all hoar</p>
					<p>With time and trials, and those helpless eyes,</p>
					<p class="i2">And heartless daughters—worn—and pale<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7">[7]</a>—and poor;</p>
					<p>Would <i>he</i> adore a sultan? <i>he</i> obey</p>
					<p>The intellectual eunuch Castlereagh?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8">[8]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Cold-blooded, smooth-faced, placid miscreant!</p>
					<p class="i2">Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin's gore,</p>
					<p>And thus for wider carnage taught to pant,</p>
					<p class="i2">Transferred to gorge upon a sister shore,</p>
					<p>The vulgarest tool that Tyranny could want,</p>
					<p class="i2">With just enough of talent, and no more,</p>
					<p>To lengthen fetters by another fixed,</p>
					<p>And offer poison long already mixed.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>An orator of such set trash of phrase</p>
					<p class="i2">Ineffably—legitimately vile,</p>
					<p>That even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,</p>
					<p class="i2">Nor foes—all nations—condescend to smile,—</p>
					<p>Nor even a sprightly blunder's spark can blaze</p>
					<p class="i2">From that Ixion grindstone's ceaseless toil,</p>
					<p>That turns and turns to give the world a notion</p>
					<p>Of endless torments and perpetual motion.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>A bungler even in its disgusting trade,</p>
					<p class="i2">And botching, patching, leaving still behind</p>
					<p>Something of which its masters are afraid—</p>
					<p class="i2">States to be curbed, and thoughts to be confined,</p>
					<p>Conspiracy or Congress to be made—</p>
					<p class="i2">Cobbling at manacles for all mankind—</p>
					<p>A tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,</p>
					<p>With God and Man's abhorrence for its gains.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>If we may judge of matter by the mind,</p>
					<p class="i2">Emasculated to the marrow <i>It</i></p>
					<p>Hath but two objects, how to serve, and bind,</p>
					<p class="i2">Deeming the chain it wears even men may fit,</p>
					<p>Eutropius of its many masters,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9">[9]</a>—blind</p>
					<p class="i2">To worth as freedom, wisdom as to wit,</p>
					<p>Fearless—because <i>no</i> feeling dwells in ice,</p>
					<p>Its very courage stagnates to a vice.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10">[10]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Where shall I turn me not to <i>view</i> its bonds,</p>
					<p class="i2">For I will never <i>feel</i> them?—Italy!</p>
					<p>Thy late reviving Roman soul desponds</p>
					<p class="i2">Beneath the lie this State-thing breathed o'er thee<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11">[11]</a>—</p>
					<p>Thy clanking chain, and Erin's yet green wounds,</p>
					<p class="i2">Have voices—tongues to cry aloud for me.</p>
					<p>Europe has slaves—allies—kings—armies still—</p>
					<p>And Southey lives to sing them very ill.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Meantime, Sir Laureate, I proceed to dedicate,</p>
					<p class="i2">In honest simple verse, this song to you.</p>
					<p>And, if in flattering strains I do not predicate,</p>
					<p class="i2">'T is that I still retain my "buff and blue;"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12">[12]</a></p>
					<p>My politics as yet are all to educate:</p>
					<p class="i2">Apostasy's so fashionable, too,</p>
					<p>To keep <i>one</i> creed's a task grown quite Herculean;</p>
					<p>Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13">[13]</a></p>
