			<h3>I.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The world is full of orphans: firstly, those</p>
					<p class="i2">Who are so in the strict sense of the phrase;</p>
					<p>But many a lonely tree the loftier grows</p>
					<p class="i2">Than others crowded in the Forest's maze—</p>
					<p>The next are such as are not doomed to lose</p>
					<p class="i2">Their tender parents, in their budding days,</p>
					<p>But, merely, their parental tenderness,</p>
					<p>Which leaves them orphans of the heart no less.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>II.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The next are "<i>only</i> Children," as they are styled,</p>
					<p class="i2">Who grow up <i>Children</i> only, since th' old saw</p>
					<p>Pronounces that an "only's" a spoilt child—</p>
					<p class="i2">But not to go too far, I hold it law,</p>
					<p>That where their education, harsh or mild,</p>
					<p class="i2">Transgresses the great bounds of love or awe,</p>
					<p>The sufferers—be 't in heart or intellect—</p>
					<p>Whate'er the <i>cause</i>, are orphans in <i>effect</i>.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>III.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But to return unto the stricter rule—</p>
					<p class="i2">As far as words make rules—our common notion</p>
					<p>Of orphan paints at once a parish school,</p>
					<p class="i2">A half-starved babe, a wreck upon Life's ocean,</p>
					<p>A human (what the Italians nickname) "Mule!"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_814">[814]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">A theme for Pity or some worse emotion;</p>
					<p>Yet, if examined, it might be admitted</p>
					<p>The wealthiest orphans are to be more pitied.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Too soon they are Parents to themselves: for what</p>
					<p class="i2">Are Tutors, Guardians, and so forth, compared</p>
					<p>With Nature's genial Genitors? so that</p>
					<p class="i2">A child of Chancery, that Star-Chamber ward,</p>
					<p>(I'll take the likeness I can first come at,)</p>
					<p class="i2">Is like—a duckling by Dame Partlett reared,</p>
					<p>And frights—especially if 'tis a daughter,</p>
					<p>Th' old Hen—by running headlong to the water.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>V.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>There is a common-place book argument,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which glibly glides from every tongue;</p>
					<p>When any dare a new light to present,</p>
					<p class="i2">"If you are right, then everybody's wrong"!</p>
					<p>Suppose the converse of this precedent</p>
					<p class="i2">So often urged, so loudly and so long;</p>
					<p>"If you are wrong, then everybody's right"!</p>
					<p>Was ever everybody yet so quite?</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Therefore I would solicit free discussion</p>
					<p class="i2">Upon all points—no matter what, or whose—</p>
					<p>Because as Ages upon Ages push on,</p>
					<p class="i2">The last is apt the former to accuse</p>
					<p>Of pillowing its head on a pin-cushion,</p>
					<p class="i2">Heedless of pricks because it was obtuse:</p>
					<p>What was a paradox becomes a truth or</p>
					<p>A something like it—witness Luther!</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The Sacraments have been reduced to two,</p>
					<p class="i2">And Witches unto none, though somewhat late</p>
					<p>Since burning agéd women (save a few—</p>
					<p class="i2">Not witches only b—ches—who create</p>
					<p>Mischief in families, as some know or knew,</p>
					<p class="i2">Should still be singed, but lightly, let me state,)</p>
					<p>Has been declared an act of inurbanity,</p>
					<p><i>Malgré</i> Sir Matthew Hales's great humanity.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Great Galileo was debarred the Sun,</p>
					<p class="i2">Because he fixed it; and, to stop his talking,</p>
					<p>How Earth could round the solar orbit run,</p>
					<p class="i2">Found his own legs embargoed from mere walking:</p>
					<p>The man was well-nigh dead, ere men begun</p>
					<p class="i2">To think his skull had not some need of caulking;</p>
					<p>But now, it seems, he's right—his notion just:</p>
					<p>No doubt a consolation to his dust.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Pythagoras, Locke, Socrates—but pages</p>
					<p class="i2">Might be filled up, as vainly as before,</p>
					<p>With the sad usage of all sorts of sages,</p>
					<p class="i2">Who in his life-time, each, was deemed a Bore!</p>
					<p>The loftiest minds outrun their tardy ages:</p>
					<p class="i2">This they must bear with and, perhaps, much more;</p>
					<p>The wise man's sure when he no more can share it, he</p>
					<p>Will have a firm Post Obit on posterity.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>X.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>If such doom waits each intellectual Giant,</p>
					<p class="i2">We little people in our lesser way,</p>
					<p>In Life's small rubs should surely be more pliant,</p>
					<p class="i2">And so for one will I—as well I may—</p>
					<p>Would that I were less bilious—but, oh, fie on 't!</p>
					<p class="i4">Just as I make my mind up every day,</p>
					<p>To be a "<i>totus, teres</i>," Stoic, Sage,</p>
					<p>The wind shifts and I fly into a rage.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Temperate I am—yet never had a temper;</p>
					<p class="i2">Modest I am—yet with some slight assurance;</p>
					<p>Changeable too—yet somehow "<i>Idem semper</i>:"</p>
					<p class="i2">Patient—but not enamoured of endurance;</p>
					<p>Cheerful—but, sometimes, rather apt to whimper:</p>
					<p class="i2">Mild—but at times a sort of "<i>Hercules furens</i>:"</p>
					<p>So that I almost think that the same skin</p>
					<p>For one without—has two or three within.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Our Hero was, in Canto the Sixteenth,</p>
					<p class="i2">Left in a tender moonlight situation,</p>
					<p>Such as enables Man to show his strength</p>
					<p class="i2">Moral or physical: on this occasion</p>
					<p>Whether his virtue triumphed—or, at length,</p>
					<p class="i2">His vice—for he was of a kindling nation—</p>
					<p>Is more than I shall venture to describe;—</p>
					<p>Unless some Beauty with a kiss should bribe.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I leave the thing a problem, like all things:—</p>
					<p class="i2">The morning came—and breakfast, tea and toast,</p>
					<p>Of which most men partake, but no one sings.</p>
					<p class="i2">The company whose birth, wealth, worth, has cost</p>
					<p>My trembling Lyre already several strings,</p>
					<p class="i2">Assembled with our hostess, and mine host;</p>
					<p>The guests dropped in—the last but one, Her Grace,</p>
					<p>The latest, Juan, with his virgin face.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Which best it is to encounter—Ghost, or none,</p>
					<p class="i2">'Twere difficult to say—but Juan looked</p>
					<p>As if he had combated with more than one,</p>
					<p class="i2">Being wan and worn, with eyes that hardly brooked</p>
					<p>The light, that through the Gothic window shone:</p>
					<p class="i2">Her Grace, too, had a sort of air rebuked—</p>
					<p>Seemed pale and shivered, as if she had kept</p>
					<p>A vigil, or dreamt rather more than slept.</p>
