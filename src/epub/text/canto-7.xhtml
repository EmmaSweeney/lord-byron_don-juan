					<p>O Love! O Glory! what are ye who fly</p>

					<p>There's not a meteor in the polar sky</p>
					<p class="i2">Of such transcendent and more fleeting flight.</p>

					<p>When we know what all are, we must bewail us,</p>
					<p class="i2">But ne'ertheless I hope it is no crime</p>

					<p>The Russians, having built two batteries on</p>

					<p>John Johnson, seeing their extreme dismay,</p>
					<p class="i2">Though little versed in feelings oriental,</p>
					<p>Suggested some slight comfort in his way:</p>
					<p class="i2">Don Juan, who was much more sentimental,</p>
					<p>Swore they should see him by the dawn of day,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or that the Russian army should repent all:</p>
					<p>And, strange to say, they found some consolation</p>
					<p>In this—for females like exaggeration.</p>

					<p>And then with tears, and sighs, and some slight kisses,</p>
					<p class="i2">They parted for the present—these to await,</p>
					<p>According to the artillery's hits or misses,</p>
					<p class="i2">What sages call Chance, Providence, or Fate—</p>
					<p>(Uncertainty is one of many blisses,</p>
					<p class="i2">A mortgage on Humanity's estate;)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_HV">[HV]</a></p>

					<p>Suwarrow,—who but saw things in the gross.</p>
					<p class="i2">Being much too gross to see them in detail,</p>
					<p>Who calculated life as so much dross,</p>
					<p class="i2">And as the wind a widowed nation's wail,</p>
					<p>And cared as little for his army's loss</p>
					<p class="i2">(So that their efforts should at length prevail)</p>
					<p>As wife and friends did for the boils of Job,—</p>

					<p>Nothing.—The work of Glory still went on</p>
					<p class="i2">In preparations for a cannonade</p>
					<p>As terrible as that of Ilion,</p>

					<p>But now, instead of slaying Priam's son,</p>
					<p class="i2">We only can but talk of escalade,</p>

					<p>By merely wielding with poetic arm</p>
					<p class="i2">Arms to which men will never more resort,</p>
					<p>Unless gunpowder should be found to harm</p>
					<p class="i2">Much less than is the hope of every court,</p>

					<p>And yet, like all men else, I must allow,</p>
					<p class="i2">To vie with thee would be about as vain</p>

					<p class="i2">The march! the charge! the shouts of either faith,</p>
