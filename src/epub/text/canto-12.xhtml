			<h3>I.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Of all the barbarous middle ages, that</p>
					<p class="i2">Which is most barbarous is the middle age</p>
					<p>Of man! it is—I really scarce know what;</p>
					<p class="i2">But when we hover between fool and sage,</p>
					<p>And don't know justly what we would be at—</p>
					<p class="i2">A period something like a printed page,</p>
					<p>Black letter upon foolscap, while our hair</p>
					<p>Grows grizzled, and we are not what we were;—</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>II.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Too old for Youth,—too young, at thirty-five,</p>
					<p class="i2">To herd with boys, or hoard with good threescore,—</p>
					<p>I wonder people should be left alive;</p>
					<p class="i2">But since they are, that epoch is a bore:</p>
					<p>Love lingers still, although 't were late to wive:</p>
					<p class="i2">And as for other love, the illusion's o'er;</p>
					<p>And Money, that most pure imagination,</p>
					<p>Gleams only through the dawn of its creation.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_613">[613]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>III.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>O Gold! Why call we misers miserable?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_614">[614]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Theirs is the pleasure that can never pall;</p>
					<p>Theirs is the best bower anchor, the chain cable</p>
					<p class="i2">Which holds fast other pleasures great and small.</p>
					<p>Ye who but see the saving man at table,</p>
					<p class="i2">And scorn his temperate board, as none at all,</p>
					<p>And wonder how the wealthy can be sparing,</p>
					<p>Know not what visions spring from each cheese-paring.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Love or lust makes Man sick, and wine much sicker;</p>
					<p class="i2">Ambition rends, and gaming gains a loss;</p>
					<p>But making money, slowly first, then quicker,</p>
					<p class="i2">And adding still a little through each cross</p>
					<p>(Which <i>will</i> come over things), beats Love or liquor,</p>
					<p class="i2">The gamester's counter, or the statesman's <i>dross</i>.</p>
					<p>O Gold! I still prefer thee unto paper,</p>
					<p>Which makes bank credit like a bank of <i>vapour</i>.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>V.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Who hold the balance of the World? Who reign</p>
					<p class="i2">O'er congress, whether royalist or liberal?</p>
					<p>Who rouse the shirtless patriots of Spain?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_615">[615]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">(That make old Europe's journals "squeak and gibber"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_616">[616]</a> all)</p>
					<p>Who keep the World, both old and new, in pain</p>
					<p class="i2">Or pleasure? Who make politics run glibber all?</p>
					<p>The shade of Buonaparte's noble daring?—</p>
					<p>Jew Rothschild,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_617">[617]</a> and his fellow-Christian, Baring.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Those, and the truly liberal Lafitte,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_618">[618]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Are the true Lords of Europe. Every loan</p>
					<p>Is not a merely speculative hit,</p>
					<p class="i2">But seats a Nation or upsets a Throne.</p>
					<p>Republics also get involved a bit;</p>
					<p class="i2">Columbia's stock hath holders not unknown</p>
					<p>On 'Change; and even thy silver soil, Peru,</p>
					<p>Must get itself discounted by a Jew.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Why call the miser miserable? as</p>
					<p class="i2">I said before: the frugal life is his,</p>
					<p>Which in a saint or cynic ever was</p>
					<p class="i2">The theme of praise: a hermit would not miss</p>
					<p>Canonization for the self-same cause,</p>
					<p class="i2">And wherefore blame gaunt Wealth's austerities?</p>
					<p>Because, you 'll say, nought calls for such a trial;—</p>
					<p>Then there's more merit in his self-denial.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>He is your only poet;—Passion, pure</p>
					<p class="i2">And sparkling on from heap to heap, displays,</p>
					<p><i>Possessed</i>, the ore, of which <i>mere hopes</i> allure</p>
					<p class="i2">Nations athwart the deep: the golden rays</p>
					<p>Flash up in ingots from the mine obscure:</p>
					<p class="i2">On him the Diamond pours its brilliant blaze,</p>
					<p>While the mild Emerald's beam shades down the dies</p>
					<p>Of other stones, to soothe the miser's eyes.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The lands on either side are his; the ship</p>
					<p class="i2">From Ceylon, Inde, or far Cathay, unloads</p>
					<p>For him the fragrant produce of each trip;</p>
					<p class="i2">Beneath his cars of Ceres groan the roads,</p>
					<p>And the vine blushes like Aurora's lip;</p>
					<p class="i2">His very cellars might be Kings' abodes;</p>
					<p>While he, despising every sensual call,</p>
					<p>Commands—the intellectual Lord of <i>all</i>.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>X.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Perhaps he hath great projects in his mind,</p>
					<p class="i2">To build a college, or to found a race,</p>
					<p>A hospital, a church,—and leave behind</p>
					<p class="i2">Some dome surmounted by his meagre face:</p>
					<p>Perhaps he fain would liberate Mankind</p>
					<p class="i2">Even with the very ore which makes them base;</p>
					<p>Perhaps he would be wealthiest of his nation,</p>
					<p>Or revel in the joys of calculation.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But whether all, or each, or none of these</p>
					<p class="i2">May be the hoarder's principle of action,</p>
					<p>The fool will call such mania a disease:—</p>
					<p class="i2">What is his <i>own?</i> Go—look at each transaction,</p>
					<p>Wars, revels, loves—do these bring men more ease</p>
					<p class="i2">Than the mere plodding through each "vulgar fraction?"</p>
					<p>Or do they benefit Mankind? Lean Miser!</p>
					<p>Let spendthrifts' heirs inquire of yours—who's wiser?</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>How beauteous are rouleaus! how charming chests</p>
					<p class="i2">Containing ingots, bags of dollars, coins</p>
					<p>(Not of old victors, all whose heads and crests</p>
					<p class="i2">Weigh not the thin ore where their visage shines,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_LG">[LG]</a></p>
					<p>But) of fine unclipped gold, where dully rests</p>
					<p class="i2">Some likeness, which the glittering cirque confines,</p>
					<p>Of modern, reigning, sterling, stupid stamp!—</p>
					<p>Yes! ready money <i>is</i> Aladdin's lamp.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_619">[619]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"Love rules the Camp, the Court, the Grove,—for Love</p>
					<p class="i2">Is Heaven, and Heaven is Love:"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_620">[620]</a>—so sings the bard;</p>
					<p>Which it were rather difficult to prove</p>
					<p class="i2">(A thing with poetry in general hard).</p>
					<p>Perhaps there may be something in "the Grove,"</p>
					<p class="i2">At least it rhymes to "Love:" but I'm prepared</p>
					<p>To doubt (no less than landlords of their rental)</p>
					<p>If "Courts" and "Camps" be quite so sentimental.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But if Love don't, <i>Cash</i> does, and Cash alone:</p>
					<p class="i2">Cash rules the Grove, and fells it too besides;</p>
					<p>Without cash, camps were thin, and courts were none;</p>
					<p class="i2">Without cash, Malthus tells you—"take no brides."<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_621">[621]</a></p>
					<p>So Cash rules Love the ruler, on his own</p>
					<p class="i2">High ground, as virgin Cynthia sways the tides:</p>
					<p>And as for "Heaven being Love," why not say honey</p>
					<p>Is wax? Heaven is not Love, 't is Matrimony.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Is not all Love prohibited whatever,</p>
					<p class="i2">Excepting Marriage? which is Love, no doubt,</p>
					<p>After a sort; but somehow people never</p>
					<p class="i2">With the same thought the two words have helped out.</p>
					<p>Love may exist <i>with</i> Marriage, and <i>should</i> ever,</p>
					<p class="i2">And Marriage also may exist without;</p>
					<p>But Love <i>sans</i> banns is both a sin and shame,</p>
					<p>And ought to go by quite another name.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Now if the "Court," and "Camp," and "Grove," be not</p>
					<p class="i2">Recruited all with constant married men,</p>
					<p>Who never coveted their neighbour's lot,</p>
					<p class="i2">I say <i>that</i> line's a lapsus of the pen;—</p>
					<p>Strange too in my <i>buon camerado</i> Scott,</p>
					<p class="i2">So celebrated for his morals, when</p>
					<p>My Jeffrey held him up as an example<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_622">[622]</a></p>
					<p>To me;—of whom these morals are a sample.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_LH">[LH]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Well, if I don't succeed, I <i>have</i> succeeded,</p>
					<p class="i2">And that's enough; succeeded in my youth,</p>
					<p>The only time when much success is needed:</p>
					<p class="i2">And my success produced what I, in sooth,</p>
					<p>Cared most about; it need not now be pleaded—</p>
					<p class="i2">Whate'er it was, 'twas mine; I've paid, in truth,</p>
					<p>Of late, the penalty of such success,</p>
					<p>But have not learned to wish it any less.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>That suit in Chancery,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_623">[623]</a>—which some persons plead</p>
					<p class="i2">In an appeal to the unborn, whom they,</p>
					<p>In the faith of their procreative creed,</p>
					<p class="i2">Baptize Posterity, or future clay,—</p>
					<p>To me seems but a dubious kind of reed</p>
					<p class="i2">To lean on for support in any way;</p>
					<p>Since odds are that Posterity will know</p>
					<p>No more of them, than they of her, I trow.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIX.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_LI">[LI]</a></h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Why, I'm Posterity—and so are you;</p>
					<p class="i2">And whom do we remember? Not a hundred.</p>
					<p>Were every memory written down all true,</p>
					<p class="i2">The tenth or twentieth name would be but blundered;</p>
					<p>Even Plutarch's Lives have but picked out a few,</p>
					<p class="i2">And 'gainst those few your annalists have thundered;</p>
					<p>And Mitford<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_624">[624]</a> in the nineteenth century</p>
					<p>Gives, with Greek truth, the good old Greek the lie.</p>

			<h3>XX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Good people all, of every degree,</p>
					<p class="i2">Ye gentle readers and ungentle writers,</p>
					<p>In this twelfth Canto 't is my wish to be</p>
					<p class="i2">As serious as if I had for inditers</p>
					<p>Malthus and Wilberforce:—the last set free</p>
					<p class="i2">The Negroes, and is worth a million fighters;</p>
					<p>While Wellington has but enslaved the Whites,</p>
					<p>And Malthus<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_625">[625]</a> does the thing 'gainst which he writes.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I'm serious—so are all men upon paper;</p>
					<p class="i2">And why should I not form my speculation,</p>
					<p>And hold up to the Sun my little taper?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_626">[626]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Mankind just now seem wrapped in meditation</p>
					<p>On constitutions and steam-boats of vapour;</p>
					<p class="i2">While sages write against all procreation,</p>

					<p>Of feeding brats the moment his wife weans.</p>

			<h3>XXII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>That's noble! That's romantic! For my part,</p>
					<p class="i2">I think that "Philo-genitiveness" is—</p>
					<p>(Now here's a word quite after my own heart,</p>
					<p class="i2">Though there's a shorter a good deal than this,</p>
					<p>If that politeness set it not apart;</p>
					<p class="i2">But I'm resolved to say nought that's amiss)—</p>
					<p>I say, methinks that "Philo-genitiveness"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_627">[627]</a></p>
					<p>Might meet from men a little more forgiveness.</p>

			</div>
			<h3>XXIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And now to business.—O my gentle Juan!</p>
					<p class="i2">Thou art in London—in that pleasant place,</p>
					<p>Where every kind of mischief's daily brewing,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which can await warm Youth in its wild race.</p>
					<p>'T is true, that thy career is not a new one;</p>
					<p class="i2">Thou art no novice in the headlong chase</p>
					<p>Of early life; but this is a new land,</p>
					<p>Which foreigners can never understand.</p>

			<h3>XXIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>What with a small diversity of climate,</p>
					<p class="i2">Of hot or cold, mercurial or sedate,</p>
					<p>I could send forth my mandate like a Primate</p>
					<p class="i2">Upon the rest of Europe's social state;</p>
					<p>But thou art the most difficult to rhyme at,</p>
					<p class="i2">Great Britain, which the Muse may penetrate.</p>
					<p>All countries have their "Lions," but in thee</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But I am sick of politics. Begin—</p>

					<p class="i2">Above the ice had like a skater glided:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_LJ">[LJ]</a></p>
					<p>When tired of play, he flirted without sin</p>
					<p class="i2">With some of those fair creatures who have prided</p>
					<p>Themselves on innocent tantalisation,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_LK">[LK]</a></p>
					<p>And hate all vice except its reputation.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But these are few, and in the end they make</p>
					<p class="i2">Some devilish escapade or stir, which shows</p>
					<p>That even the purest people may mistake</p>
					<p class="i2">Their way through Virtue's primrose paths of snows;</p>
					<p>And then men stare, as if a new ass spake</p>
					<p class="i2">To Balaam, and from tongue to ear o'erflows</p>
					<p>Quicksilver small talk, ending (if you note it)</p>
					<p>With the kind World's Amen—"Who would have thought it?"</p>

			<h3>XXVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The little Leila, with her Orient eyes,</p>
					<p class="i2">And taciturn Asiatic disposition,</p>
					<p>(Which saw all Western things with small surprise,</p>

					<p>Who think that novelties are butterflies</p>

					<p>Her charming figure and romantic history</p>
					<p>Became a kind of fashionable mystery.</p>

			<h3>XXVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The women much divided—as is usual</p>
					<p class="i2">Amongst the sex in little things or great—</p>
					<p>Think not, fair creatures, that I mean to abuse you all,</p>
					<p class="i2">I have always liked you better than I state—</p>
					<p>Since I've grown moral, still I must accuse you all</p>
					<p class="i2">Of being apt to talk at a great rate;</p>
					<p>And now there was a general sensation</p>
					<p>Amongst you, about Leila's education.</p>

			</div>
			<h3>XXIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>In one point only were you settled—and</p>

					<p class="i2">And far away, the last bud of her race,</p>
					<p>Howe'er our friend Don Juan might command</p>
					<p class="i2">Himself for five, four, three, or two years' space,</p>

			<h3>XXX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>So first there was a generous emulation,</p>
					<p class="i2">And then there was a general competition,</p>
					<p>To undertake the orphan's education:</p>

					<p>It had been an affront on this occasion</p>
					<p class="i2">To talk of a subscription or petition;</p>
