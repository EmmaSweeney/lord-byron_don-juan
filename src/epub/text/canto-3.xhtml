			<h3>I.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Hail, Muse! <i>et cetera.</i>—We left Juan sleeping,</p>
					<p class="i2">Pillowed upon a fair and happy breast,</p>
					<p>And watched by eyes that never yet knew weeping,</p>
					<p class="i2">And loved by a young heart, too deeply blest</p>
					<p>To feel the poison through her spirit creeping,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or know who rested there, a foe to rest,</p>
					<p>Had soiled the current of her sinless years,</p>
					<p>And turned her pure heart's purest blood to tears!</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>II.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Oh, Love! what is it in this world of ours</p>
					<p class="i2">Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah why</p>
					<p>With cypress branches hast thou wreathed thy bowers,</p>
					<p class="i2">And made thy best interpreter a sigh?</p>
					<p>As those who dote on odours pluck the flowers,</p>
					<p class="i2">And place them on their breast—but place to die—</p>
					<p>Thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish</p>
					<p>Are laid within our bosoms but to perish.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>III.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>In her first passion Woman loves her lover,</p>
					<p class="i2">In all the others all she loves is Love,</p>
					<p>Which grows a habit she can ne'er get over,</p>
					<p class="i2">And fits her loosely—like an easy glove,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_CH">[CH]</a></p>
					<p>As you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:</p>
					<p class="i2">One man alone at first her heart can move;</p>
					<p>She then prefers him in the plural number,</p>
					<p>Not finding that the additions much encumber.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I know not if the fault be men's or theirs;</p>
					<p class="i2">But one thing's pretty sure; a woman planted</p>
					<p>(Unless at once she plunge for life in prayers)—</p>
					<p class="i2">After a decent time must be gallanted;</p>
					<p>Although, no doubt, her first of love affairs</p>
					<p class="i2">Is that to which her heart is wholly granted;</p>
					<p>Yet there are some, they say, who have had <i>none</i>,</p>
					<p>But those who have ne'er end with only <i>one</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_170">[170]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>V.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>'T is melancholy, and a fearful sign</p>
					<p class="i2">Of human frailty, folly, also crime,</p>
					<p>That Love and Marriage rarely can combine,</p>
					<p class="i2">Although they both are born in the same clime;</p>
					<p>Marriage from Love, like vinegar from wine—</p>
					<p class="i2">A sad, sour, sober beverage—by Time</p>
					<p>Is sharpened from its high celestial flavour</p>
					<p>Down to a very homely household savour.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>There's something of antipathy, as 't were,</p>
					<p class="i2">Between their present and their future state;</p>
					<p>A kind of flattery that's hardly fair</p>
					<p class="i2">Is used until the truth arrives too late—</p>
					<p>Yet what can people do, except despair?</p>
					<p class="i2">The same things change their names at such a rate;</p>
					<p>For instance—Passion in a lover's glorious,</p>
					<p>But in a husband is pronounced uxorious.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Men grow ashamed of being so very fond;</p>
					<p class="i2">They sometimes also get a little tired</p>
					<p>(But that, of course, is rare), and then despond:</p>
					<p class="i2">The same things cannot always be admired,</p>
					<p>Yet 't is "so nominated in the bond,"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_171">[171]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">That both are tied till one shall have expired.</p>
					<p>Sad thought! to lose the spouse that was adorning</p>
					<p>Our days, and put one's servants into mourning.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>There's doubtless something in domestic doings</p>
					<p class="i2">Which forms, in fact, true Love's antithesis;</p>
					<p>Romances paint at full length people's wooings,</p>
					<p class="i2">But only give a bust of marriages;</p>
					<p>For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,</p>
					<p class="i2">There's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:</p>
					<p>Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,</p>
					<p>He would have written sonnets all his life?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_CI">[CI]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>All tragedies are finished by a death,</p>
					<p class="i2">All comedies are ended by a marriage;</p>
					<p>The future states of both are left to faith,</p>
					<p class="i2">For authors fear description might disparage</p>
					<p>The worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,</p>
					<p class="i2">And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;</p>
					<p>So leaving each their priest and prayer-book ready,</p>
					<p>They say no more of Death or of the Lady.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_172">[172]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>X.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The only two that in my recollection,</p>
					<p class="i2">Have sung of Heaven and Hell, or marriage, are</p>
					<p>Dante<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_173">[173]</a> and Milton,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_174">[174]</a> and of both the affection</p>
					<p class="i2">Was hapless in their nuptials, for some bar</p>
					<p>Of fault or temper ruined the connection</p>
					<p class="i2">(Such things, in fact, it don't ask much to mar);</p>
					<p>But Dante's Beatrice and Milton's Eve</p>
					<p>Were not drawn from their spouses, you conceive.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Some persons say that Dante meant Theology</p>
					<p class="i2">By Beatrice, and not a mistress—I,</p>
					<p>Although my opinion may require apology,</p>
					<p class="i2">Deem this a commentator's phantasy,</p>
					<p>Unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he</p>
					<p class="i2">Decided thus, and showed good reason why;</p>
					<p>I think that Dante's more abstruse ecstatics</p>
					<p>Meant to personify the Mathematics.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_175">[175]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Haidée and Juan were not married, but</p>
					<p class="i2">The fault was theirs, not mine: it is not fair,</p>
					<p>Chaste reader, then, in any way to put</p>
					<p class="i2">The blame on me, unless you wish they were;</p>
					<p>Then if you'd have them wedded, please to shut</p>
					<p class="i2">The book which treats of this erroneous pair,</p>
					<p>Before the consequences grow too awful;</p>
					<p>'T is dangerous to read of loves unlawful.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Yet they were happy,—happy in the illicit</p>
					<p class="i2">Indulgence of their innocent desires;</p>
					<p>But more imprudent grown with every visit,</p>
					<p class="i2">Haidée forgot the island was her Sire's;</p>
					<p>When we have what we like 't is hard to miss it,</p>
					<p class="i2">At least in the beginning, ere one tires;</p>
					<p>Thus she came often, not a moment losing,</p>
					<p>Whilst her piratical papa was cruising.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Let not his mode of raising cash seem strange,</p>
					<p class="i2">Although he fleeced the flags of every nation,</p>
					<p>For into a Prime Minister but change</p>
					<p class="i2">His title, and 't is nothing but taxation;</p>
					<p>But he, more modest, took an humbler range</p>
					<p class="i2">Of Life, and in an honester vocation</p>
					<p>Pursued o'er the high seas his watery journey,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_CJ">[CJ]</a></p>
					<p>And merely practised as a sea-attorney.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The good old gentleman had been detained</p>
					<p class="i2">By winds and waves, and some important captures;</p>
					<p>And, in the hope of more, at sea remained,</p>
					<p class="i2">Although a squall or two had damped his raptures,</p>
					<p>By swamping one of the prizes; he had chained</p>
					<p class="i2">His prisoners, dividing them like chapters</p>
					<p>In numbered lots; they all had cuffs and collars,</p>
					<p>And averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Some he disposed of off Cape Matapan,</p>
					<p class="i2">Among his friends the Mainots; some he sold</p>
					<p>To his Tunis correspondents, save one man</p>
					<p class="i2">Tossed overboard unsaleable (being old);</p>
					<p>The rest—save here and there some richer one,</p>
					<p class="i2">Reserved for future ransom—in the hold,</p>
					<p>Were linked alike, as, for the common people, he</p>
					<p>Had a large order from the Dey of Tripoli.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The merchandise was served in the same way,</p>
					<p class="i2">Pieced out for different marts in the Levant,</p>
					<p>Except some certain portions of the prey,</p>
					<p class="i2">Light classic articles of female want,</p>
					<p>French stuffs, lace, tweezers, toothpicks, teapot, tray,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_CK">[CK]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Guitars and castanets from Alicant,</p>
					<p>All which selected from the spoil he gathers,</p>
					<p>Robbed for his daughter by the best of fathers.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>A monkey, a Dutch mastiff, a mackaw,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_176">[176]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Two parrots, with a Persian cat and kittens,</p>
					<p>He chose from several animals he saw—</p>
					<p class="i2">A terrier, too, which once had been a Briton's,</p>
					<p>Who dying on the coast of Ithaca,</p>
					<p class="i2">The peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance:</p>
					<p>These to secure in this strong blowing weather,</p>
					<p>He caged in one huge hamper altogether.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Then, having settled his marine affairs,</p>
					<p class="i2">Despatching single cruisers here and there,</p>
					<p>His vessel having need of some repairs,</p>
					<p class="i2">He shaped his course to where his daughter fair</p>
					<p>Continued still her hospitable cares;</p>
					<p class="i2">But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,</p>
					<p>And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,</p>
					<p>His port lay on the other side o' the isle.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And there he went ashore without delay,</p>
					<p class="i2">Having no custom-house nor quarantine</p>
					<p>To ask him awkward questions on the way,</p>
					<p class="i2">About the time and place where he had been:</p>
					<p>He left his ship to be hove down next day,</p>
					<p class="i2">With orders to the people to careen;</p>
					<p>So that all hands were busy beyond measure,</p>
					<p>In getting out goods, ballast, guns, and treasure.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Arriving at the summit of a hill</p>
					<p class="i2">Which overlooked the white walls of his home,</p>
					<p>He stopped.—What singular emotions fill</p>
					<p class="i2">Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!</p>
					<p>With fluttering doubts if all be well or ill—</p>
					<p class="i2">With love for many, and with fears for some;</p>
					<p>All feelings which o'erleap the years long lost,</p>
					<p>And bring our hearts back to their starting-post.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The approach of home to husbands and to sires,</p>
					<p class="i2">After long travelling by land or water,</p>
					<p>Most naturally some small doubt inspires—</p>
					<p class="i2">A female family's a serious matter,</p>
					<p>(None trusts the sex more, or so much admires—</p>
					<p class="i2">But they hate flattery, so I never flatter);</p>
					<p>Wives in their husbands' absences grow subtler,</p>
					<p>And daughters sometimes run off with the butler.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>An honest gentleman at his return</p>
					<p class="i2">May not have the good fortune of Ulysses;</p>
					<p>Not all lone matrons for their husbands mourn,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or show the same dislike to suitors' kisses;</p>
					<p>The odds are that he finds a handsome urn</p>
					<p class="i2">To his memory—and two or three young misses</p>
					<p>Born to some friend, who holds his wife and riches—</p>
					<p>And that <i>his</i> Argus<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_177">[177]</a>—bites him by the breeches.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>If single, probably his plighted Fair</p>
					<p class="i2">Has in his absence wedded some rich miser;</p>
					<p>But all the better, for the happy pair</p>
					<p class="i2">May quarrel, and, the lady growing wiser,</p>
					<p>He may resume his amatory care</p>
					<p class="i2">As cavalier servente, or despise her;</p>
					<p>And that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,</p>
					<p>Writes odes on the Inconstancy of Woman.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And oh! ye gentlemen who have already</p>
					<p class="i2">Some chaste <i>liaison</i> of the kind—I mean</p>
					<p>An honest friendship with a married lady—</p>
					<p class="i2">The only thing of this sort ever seen</p>
					<p>To last—of all connections the most steady,</p>
					<p class="i2">And the true Hymen, (the first's but a screen)—</p>
					<p>Yet, for all that, keep not too long away—</p>
					<p>I've known the absent wronged four times a day.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_CL">[CL]</a></p>

			<h3>XXVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Lambro, our sea-solicitor, who had</p>
					<p class="i2">Much less experience of dry land than Ocean,</p>
					<p>On seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;</p>
					<p class="i2">But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion</p>
					<p>Of the true reason of his not being sad,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or that of any other strong emotion;</p>
					<p>He loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,</p>
					<p>But knew the cause no more than a philosopher.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>He saw his white walls shining in the sun,</p>
					<p class="i2">His garden trees all shadowy and green;</p>
					<p>He heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,</p>
					<p class="i2">The distant dog-bark; and perceived between</p>
					<p>The umbrage of the wood, so cool and dun,</p>
					<p class="i2">The moving figures, and the sparkling sheen</p>
					<p>Of arms (in the East all arm)—and various dyes</p>
					<p>Of coloured garbs, as bright as butterflies.</p>

			<h3>XXVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And as the spot where they appear he nears,</p>
					<p class="i2">Surprised at these unwonted signs of idling,</p>
					<p>He hears—alas! no music of the spheres,</p>
					<p class="i2">But an unhallowed, earthly sound of fiddling!</p>
					<p>A melody which made him doubt his ears,</p>
					<p class="i2">The cause being past his guessing or unriddling;</p>
					<p>A pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after—</p>
					<p>A most unoriental roar of laughter.</p>

			<h3>XXIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And still more nearly to the place advancing,</p>
					<p class="i2">Descending rather quickly the declivity,</p>
					<p>Through the waved branches o'er the greensward glancing,</p>
					<p class="i2">'Midst other indications of festivity,</p>
					<p>Seeing a troop of his domestics dancing</p>
					<p class="i2">Like Dervises, who turn as on a pivot, he</p>
					<p>Perceived it was the Pyrrhic dance<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_178">[178]</a> so martial,</p>
					<p>To which the Levantines are very partial.</p>

					<p class="i2">Linked hand in hand, and dancing; each too having</p>
					<p>Down her white neck long floating auburn curls—</p>
					<p class="i2">(The least of which would set ten poets raving);<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_CM">[CM]</a></p>

			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And here, assembled cross-legged round their trays,</p>

					<p>Pilaus and meats of all sorts met the gaze,</p>
					<p class="i2">And flasks of Samian and of Chian wine,</p>
					<p>And sherbet cooling in the porous vase;</p>
					<p class="i2">Above them their dessert grew on its vine;—</p>
					<p>The orange and pomegranate nodding o'er,</p>
					<p>Dropped in their laps, scarce plucked, their mellow store.</p>

			<h3>XXXII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">

					<p>While peaceful as if still an unweaned lamb,</p>
					<p class="i2">The patriarch of the flock all gently cowers</p>
					<p>His sober head, majestically tame,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or eats from out the palm, or playful lowers</p>
					<p>His brow, as if in act to butt, and then</p>
					<p>Yielding to their small hands, draws back again.</p>

			<h3>XXXIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,</p>
					<p class="i2">Their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,</p>
					<p>Crimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,</p>
					<p class="i2">The gesture which enchants, the eye that speaks,</p>
					<p>The innocence which happy childhood blesses,</p>
					<p class="i2">Made quite a picture of these little Greeks;</p>
					<p>So that the philosophical beholder</p>
					<p>Sighed for their sakes—that they should e'er grow older.</p>

			<h3>XXXIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Afar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales</p>
					<p class="i2">To a sedate grey circle of old smokers,</p>

					<p class="i2">Of wonderful replies from Arab jokers,</p>
					<p>Of charms to make good gold and cure bad ails,</p>
					<p class="i2">Of rocks bewitched that open to the knockers,</p>
					<p>Of magic ladies who, by one sole act,</p>

					<p>But Lambro saw all these things with aversion,</p>
					<p class="i2">Perceiving in his absence such expenses,</p>
