				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Oh, blood and thunder! and oh, blood and wounds!</p>
					<p class="i2">These are but vulgar oaths, as you may deem,</p>
					<p>Too gentle reader! and most shocking sounds:—</p>
					<p class="i2">And so they are; yet thus is Glory's dream</p>
					<p>Unriddled, and as my true Muse expounds</p>
					<p class="i2">At present such things, since they are her theme,</p>
					<p>So be they her inspirers! Call them Mars,</p>
					<p>Bellona, what you will—they mean but wars.</p>

			<h3>II.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>All was prepared—the fire, the sword, the men</p>
					<p class="i2">To wield them in their terrible array,—</p>
					<p>The army, like a lion from his den,</p>
					<p class="i2">Marched forth with nerve and sinews bent to slay,—</p>
					<p>A human Hydra, issuing from its fen</p>
					<p class="i2">To breathe destruction on its winding way,</p>
					<p>Whose heads were heroes, which cut off in vain</p>
					<p>Immediately in others grew again.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>III.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>History can only take things in the gross;</p>
					<p class="i2">But could we know them in detail, perchance</p>
					<p>In balancing the profit and the loss,</p>
					<p class="i2">War's merit it by no means might enhance,</p>
					<p>To waste so much gold for a little dross,</p>
					<p class="i2">As hath been done, mere conquest to advance.</p>
					<p>The drying up a single tear has more</p>
					<p>Of honest fame, than shedding seas of gore.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And why?—because it brings self-approbation;</p>
					<p class="i2">Whereas the other, after all its glare,</p>
					<p>Shouts, bridges, arches, pensions from a nation,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which (it may be) has not much left to spare,</p>
					<p>A higher title, or a loftier station,</p>
					<p class="i2">Though they may make Corruption gape or stare,</p>
					<p>Yet, in the end, except in Freedom's battles,</p>
					<p>Are nothing but a child of Murder's rattles.</p>

			<h3>V.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And such they are—and such they will be found:</p>
					<p class="i2">Not so Leonidas and Washington,</p>
					<p>Whose every battle-field is holy ground,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which breathes of nations saved, not worlds undone.</p>
					<p>How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!</p>
					<p class="i2">While the mere victor's may appal or stun</p>
					<p>The servile and the vain—such names will be</p>
					<p>A watchword till the Future shall be free.</p>

			<h3>VI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The night was dark, and the thick mist allowed</p>
					<p class="i2">Nought to be seen save the artillery's flame,</p>
					<p>Which arched the horizon like a fiery cloud,</p>
					<p class="i2">And in the Danube's waters shone the same—<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_412">[412]</a></p>
					<p>A mirrored Hell! the volleying roar, and loud</p>
					<p class="i2">Long booming of each peal on peal, o'ercame</p>
					<p>The ear far more than thunder; for Heaven's flashes</p>
					<p>Spare, or smite rarely—Man's make millions ashes!</p>

			<h3>VII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The column ordered on the assault scarce passed</p>
					<p class="i2">Beyond the Russian batteries a few toises,</p>
					<p>When up the bristling Moslem rose at last,</p>
					<p class="i2">Answering the Christian thunders with like voices:</p>
					<p>Then one vast fire, air, earth, and stream embraced,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which rocked as 't were beneath the mighty noises;</p>
					<p>While the whole rampart blazed like Etna, when</p>
					<p>The restless Titan hiccups in his den;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_413">[413]</a></p>

			<h3>VIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And one enormous shout of "Allah!"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_414">[414]</a> rose</p>
					<p class="i2">In the same moment, loud as even the roar</p>
					<p>Of War's most mortal engines, to their foes</p>
					<p class="i2">Hurling defiance: city, stream, and shore</p>
					<p>Resounded "Allah!" and the clouds which close</p>
					<p class="i2">With thickening canopy the conflict o'er,</p>
					<p>Vibrate to the Eternal name. Hark! through</p>
					<p>All sounds it pierceth—"Allah! Allah Hu!"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_415">[415]</a></p>

			<h3>IX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The columns were in movement one and all,</p>
					<p class="i2">But of the portion which attacked by water,</p>
					<p>Thicker than leaves the lives began to fall,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_416">[416]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Though led by Arseniew, that great son of slaughter,</p>
					<p>As brave as ever faced both bomb and ball.</p>

			<h3>X.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The Prince de Ligne was wounded in the knee;</p>
					<p class="i2">Count Chapeau-Bras,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_IA">[IA]</a>—too, had a ball between</p>
					<p>His cap and head,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_418">[418]</a> which proves the head to be</p>
					<p class="i2">Aristocratic as was ever seen,</p>
					<p>Because it then received no injury</p>
					<p class="i2">More than the cap; in fact, the ball could mean</p>
					<p>No harm unto a right legitimate head;</p>
					<p>"Ashes to ashes"—why not lead to lead?</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Also the General Markow, Brigadier,</p>
					<p class="i2">Insisting on removal of <i>the Prince</i></p>
					<p>Amidst some groaning thousands dying near,—</p>
					<p class="i2">All common fellows, who might writhe and wince,</p>
					<p>And shriek for water into a deaf ear,—</p>
					<p class="i2">The General Markow, who could thus evince</p>
					<p>His sympathy for rank, by the same token,</p>
					<p>To teach him greater, had his own leg broken.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_419">[419]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Three hundred cannon threw up their emetic,</p>
					<p class="i2">And thirty thousand muskets flung their pills</p>
					<p>Like hail, to make a bloody Diuretic.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_420">[420]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Mortality! thou hast thy monthly bills:</p>
					<p>Thy plagues—thy famines—thy physicians—yet tick,</p>
					<p class="i2">Like the death-watch, within our ears the ills</p>
					<p>Past, present, and to come;—but all may yield</p>
					<p>To the true portrait of one battle-field;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>There the still varying pangs, which multiply</p>
					<p class="i2">Until their very number makes men hard</p>
					<p>By the infinities of agony,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which meet the gaze, whate'er it may regard—</p>
					<p>The groan, the roll in dust, the all-<i>white</i> eye</p>
					<p class="i2">Turned back within its socket,—these reward</p>
					<p>Your rank and file by thousands, while the rest</p>
					<p>May win perhaps a riband at the breast!</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Yet I love Glory;—Glory's a great thing:—</p>
					<p class="i2">Think what it is to be in your old age</p>
					<p>Maintained at the expense of your good King:</p>
					<p class="i2">A moderate pension shakes full many a sage,</p>
					<p>And Heroes are but made for bards to sing,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which is still better—thus, in verse, to wage</p>
					<p>Your wars eternally, besides enjoying</p>
					<p>Half-pay for life, make Mankind worth destroying.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The troops, already disembarked, pushed on</p>
					<p class="i2">To take a battery on the right: the others,</p>
					<p>Who landed lower down, their landing done,</p>
					<p class="i2">Had set to work as briskly as their brothers:</p>
					<p>Being grenadiers, they mounted one by one,</p>
					<p class="i2">Cheerful as children climb the breasts of mothers,</p>
					<p>O'er the intrenchment and the palisade,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_421">[421]</a></p>
					<p>Quite orderly, as if upon parade.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And this was admirable: for so hot</p>
					<p class="i2">The fire was, that were red Vesuvius loaded,</p>
					<p>Besides its lava, with all sorts of shot</p>
					<p class="i2">And shells or hells, it could not more have goaded.</p>
					<p>Of officers a third fell on the spot,</p>
					<p class="i2">A thing which Victory by no means boded</p>
					<p>To gentlemen engaged in the assault:</p>
					<p>Hounds, when the huntsman tumbles, are at fault.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But here I leave the general concern</p>
					<p class="i2">To track our Hero on his path of Fame:</p>
					<p>He must his laurels separately earn—</p>
					<p class="i2">For fifty thousand heroes, name by name,</p>
					<p>Though all deserving equally to turn</p>
					<p class="i2">A couplet, or an elegy to claim,</p>
					<p>Would form a lengthy lexicon of Glory,</p>
					<p>And, what is worse still, a much longer story:</p>

			<h3>XVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And therefore we must give the greater number</p>
					<p class="i2">To the Gazette—which doubtless fairly dealt</p>
					<p>By the deceased, who lie in famous slumber</p>
					<p class="i2">In ditches, fields, or wheresoe'er they felt</p>
					<p>Their clay for the last time their souls encumber;—</p>
					<p class="i2">Thrice happy he whose name has been well spelt</p>
					<p>In the despatch: I knew a man whose loss</p>
					<p>Was printed <i>Grove</i>, although his name was Grose.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_422">[422]</a></p>

			<h3>XIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Juan and Johnson joined a certain corps,</p>
					<p class="i2">And fought away with might and main, not knowing</p>
					<p>The way which they had never trod before,</p>
					<p class="i2">And still less guessing where they might be going;</p>
					<p>But on they marched, dead bodies trampling o'er,</p>
					<p class="i2">Firing, and thrusting, slashing, sweating, glowing,</p>
					<p>But fighting thoughtlessly enough to win,</p>
					<p>To their <i>two</i> selves, <i>one</i> whole bright bulletin.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Thus on they wallowed in the bloody mire</p>
					<p class="i2">Of dead and dying thousands,—sometimes gaining</p>
					<p>A yard or two of ground, which brought them nigher</p>
					<p class="i2">To some odd angle for which all were straining;</p>
					<p>At other times, repulsed by the close fire,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which really poured as if all Hell were raining</p>
					<p>Instead of Heaven, they stumbled backwards o'er</p>
					<p>A wounded comrade, sprawling in his gore.</p>

			<h3>XXI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Though 't was Don Juan's first of fields, and though</p>

					<p>In the chill dark, when Courage does not glow</p>
					<p class="i2">So much as under a triumphal arch,</p>
					<p>Perhaps might make him shiver, yawn, or throw</p>
					<p class="i2">A glance on the dull clouds (as thick as starch,</p>
					<p>Which stiffened Heaven) as if he wished for day;—</p>
					<p>Yet for all this he did not run away.</p>

					<p>Indeed he could not. But what if he had?</p>
					<p class="i2">There <i>have been</i> and <i>are</i> heroes who begun</p>
					<p>With something not much better, or as bad:</p>
					<p class="i2">Frederick the Great from Molwitz<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_423">[423]</a> deigned to run,</p>
					<p>For the first and last time; for, like a pad,</p>

					<p>Warm bout are broken in to their new tricks,</p>

					<p class="i2">With Hannibal, and wears the Tyrian tunic</p>
					<p>Of Dido's alphabet—and this is rational</p>

			<h3>XXIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But Juan was quite "a broth of a boy,"</p>

					<p>Now swimming in the sentiment of joy,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or the <i>sensation</i> (if that phrase seem wrong),</p>
					<p>And afterward, if he must needs destroy,</p>
					<p class="i2">In such good company as always throng</p>

			<h3>XXV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But always without malice: if he warred</p>

					<p>Intentions," which form all Mankind's <i>trump card</i>,</p>
					<p class="i2">To be produced when brought up to the test.</p>
					<p>The statesman—hero—harlot—lawyer—ward</p>
					<p class="i2">Off each attack, when people are in quest</p>
					<p>Of their designs, by saying they <i>meant well</i>;</p>

			<h3>XXVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I almost lately have begun to doubt</p>

					<p>Must not have latterly been quite worn out,</p>
					<p class="i2">Not by the numbers good intent hath saved,</p>
					<p>But by the mass who go below without</p>
					<p class="i2">Those ancient good intentions, which once shaved</p>
					<p>And smoothed the brimstone of that street of Hell</p>
					<p>Which bears the greatest likeness to Pall Mall.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_IB">[IB]</a></p>

			<h3>XXVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Juan, by some strange chance, which oft divides</p>

					<p>Like chastest wives from constant husbands' sides</p>
					<p class="i2">Just at the close of the first bridal year,</p>
					<p>By one of those odd turns of Fortune's tides,</p>
					<p class="i2">Was on a sudden rather puzzled here,</p>

			<h3>XXVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I don't know how the thing occurred—it might</p>
					<p class="i2">Be that the greater part were killed or wounded,</p>
					<p>And that the rest had faced unto the right</p>
					<p class="i2">About; a circumstance which has confounded</p>
					<p>Cæsar himself, who, in the very sight</p>
					<p class="i2">Of his whole army, which so much abounded</p>
					<p>In courage, was obliged to snatch a shield,</p>
					<p>And rally back his Romans to the field.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_426">[426]</a></p>

			<h3>XXIX.</h3>

					<p class="i2">Stopped for a minute, as perhaps he ought</p>
					<p>For a much longer time; then, like an ass</p>

					<p class="i2">Over the hills, a fire enough to blind</p>
					<p>Those who dislike to look upon a fray,</p>
					<p class="i2">He stumbled on, to try if he could find</p>
					<p>A path, to add his own slight arm and forces</p>
					<p>To corps, the greater part of which were corses.</p>
