					<p>Her reason being weak, her passions strong,</p>
					<p class="i2">She thought that her Lord's heart (even could she claim it)</p>

					<p>It is observed that ladies are litigious</p>

					<p>Polygamy may well be held in dread,</p>

					<p class="i2">Would like (I think) to trust all to desire,</p>
					<p>Which is but a precarious bond, in sooth,</p>

					<p>That is, we cannot pardon their bad taste,</p>

					<p>"What dost thou know of Love or feeling?—Wretch!</p>
					<p class="i2">Begone!" she cried, with kindling eyes—"and do</p>
					<p>My bidding!" Baba vanished, for to stretch</p>
					<p class="i2">His own remonstrance further he well knew</p>
					<p>Might end in acting as his own "Jack Ketch;"</p>
					<p class="i2">And though he wished extremely to get through</p>
					<p>This awkward business without harm to others,</p>
					<p>He still preferred his own neck to another's.</p>

					<p>Away he went then upon his commission,</p>
					<p class="i2">Growling and grumbling in good Turkish phrase</p>
					<p>Against all women of whate'er condition,</p>
					<p class="i2">Especially Sultanas and their ways;</p>
					<p>Their obstinacy, pride, and indecision,</p>
					<p class="i2">Their never knowing their own mind two days,</p>
					<p>The trouble that they gave, their immorality,</p>
					<p>Which made him daily bless his own neutrality.</p>

					<p>And then he called his brethren to his aid,</p>
					<p class="i2">And sent one on a summons to the pair,</p>
					<p>That they must instantly be well arrayed,</p>
					<p class="i2">And above all be combed even to a hair,</p>
					<p>And brought before the Empress, who had made</p>
					<p class="i2">Inquiries after them with kindest care:</p>
					<p>At which Dudù looked strange, and Juan silly;</p>
					<p>But go they must at once, and will I—nill I.</p>

					<p>And here I leave them at their preparation</p>
					<p class="i2">For the imperial presence, wherein whether</p>
					<p>Gulbeyaz showed them both commiseration,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or got rid of the parties altogether,</p>
					<p>Like other angry ladies of her nation,—</p>
					<p class="i2">Are things the turning of a hair or feather</p>
					<p>May settle; but far be 't from me to anticipate</p>
					<p>In what way feminine caprice may dissipate.</p>

					<p>I leave them for the present with good wishes,</p>
					<p class="i2">Though doubts of their well doing, to arrange</p>
					<p>Another part of History; for the dishes</p>
					<p class="i2">Of this our banquet we must sometimes change;</p>
					<p>And trusting Juan may escape the fishes,</p>
					<p class="i2">(Although his situation now seems strange,</p>
					<p>And scarce secure),—as such digressions <i>are</i> fair,</p>
					<p>The Muse will take a little touch at warfare.</p>
