				<div class="stanza">
					<p>If from great Nature's or our own abyss<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_703">[703]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Of Thought we could but snatch a certainty,</p>
					<p>Perhaps Mankind might find the path they miss—</p>
					<p class="i2">But then 't would spoil much good philosophy.</p>
					<p>One system eats another up, and this<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_704">[704]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Much as old Saturn ate his progeny;</p>
					<p>For when his pious consort gave him stones</p>
					<p>In lieu of sons, of these he made no bones.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>II.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But System doth reverse the Titan's breakfast,</p>
					<p class="i2">And eats her parents, albeit the digestion</p>
					<p>Is difficult. Pray tell me, can you make fast,</p>
					<p class="i2">After due search, your faith to any question?</p>
					<p>Look back o'er ages, ere unto the stake fast</p>
					<p class="i2">You bind yourself, and call some mode the best one.</p>
					<p>Nothing more true than <i>not</i> to trust your senses;</p>
					<p>And yet what are your other evidences?</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>III.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>For me, I know nought; nothing I deny,</p>
					<p class="i2">Admit—reject—contemn: and what know <i>you</i>,</p>
					<p>Except perhaps that you were born to die?</p>
					<p class="i2">And both may after all turn out untrue.</p>
					<p>An age may come, Font of Eternity,</p>
					<p class="i2">When nothing shall be either old or new.</p>
					<p>Death, so called, is a thing which makes men weep,</p>
					<p>And yet a third of Life is passed in sleep.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>A sleep without dreams, after a rough day</p>
					<p class="i2">Of toil, is what we covet most; and yet</p>
					<p>How clay shrinks back from more quiescent clay!</p>
					<p class="i2">The very Suicide that pays his debt</p>
					<p>At once without instalments (an old way</p>
					<p class="i2">Of paying debts, which creditors regret),</p>
					<p>Lets out impatiently his rushing breath,</p>
					<p>Less from disgust of Life than dread of Death.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>V.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>'T is round him—near him—here—there—everywhere—</p>
					<p class="i2">And there's a courage which grows out of fear,</p>
					<p>Perhaps of all most desperate, which will dare</p>
					<p class="i2">The worst to <i>know</i> it:—when the mountains rear</p>
					<p>Their peaks beneath your human foot, and there</p>
					<p class="i2">You look down o'er the precipice, and drear</p>
					<p>The gulf of rock yawns,—you can't gaze a minute,</p>
					<p>Without an awful wish to plunge within it.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>'T is true, you don't—but, pale and struck with terror,</p>
					<p class="i2">Retire: but look into your past impression!</p>
					<p>And you will find, though shuddering at the mirror</p>
					<p class="i2">Of your own thoughts, in all their self-confession,</p>
					<p>The lurking bias,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_705">[705]</a> be it truth or error,</p>
					<p class="i2">To the <i>unknown</i>; a secret prepossession,</p>
					<p>To plunge with all your fears—but where? You know not,</p>
					<p>And that's the reason why you do—or do not.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But what's this to the purpose? you will say.</p>
					<p class="i2">Gent. reader, nothing; a mere speculation,</p>
					<p>For which my sole excuse is—'t is my way;</p>
					<p class="i2">Sometimes <i>with</i> and sometimes without occasion,</p>
					<p>I write what's uppermost, without delay;</p>
					<p class="i2">This narrative is not meant for narration,</p>
					<p>But a mere airy and fantastic basis,</p>
					<p>To build up common things with common places.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>You know, or don't know, that great Bacon saith,</p>
					<p class="i2">"Fling up a straw, 't will show the way the wind blows;"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_706">[706]</a></p>
					<p>And such a straw, borne on by human breath,</p>
					<p class="i2">Is Poesy, according as the Mind glows;</p>
					<p>A paper kite which flies 'twixt Life and Death,</p>
					<p class="i2">A shadow which the onward Soul behind throws:</p>
					<p>And mine's a bubble, not blown up for praise,</p>
					<p>But just to play with, as an infant plays.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The World is all before me<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_707">[707]</a>—or behind;</p>
					<p class="i2">For I have seen a portion of that same,</p>
					<p>And quite enough for me to keep in mind;—</p>
					<p class="i2">Of passions, too, I have proved enough to blame,</p>
					<p>To the great pleasure of our friends, Mankind,</p>
					<p class="i2">Who like to mix some slight alloy with fame;</p>
					<p>For I was rather famous in my time,</p>
					<p>Until I fairly knocked it up with rhyme.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>X.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I have brought this world about my ears, and eke</p>
					<p class="i2">The other; that's to say, the Clergy—who</p>
					<p>Upon my head have bid their thunders break</p>
					<p class="i2">In pious libels by no means a few.</p>
					<p>And yet I can't help scribbling once a week,</p>
					<p class="i2">Tiring old readers, nor discovering new.</p>
					<p>In Youth I wrote because my mind was full,</p>
					<p>And <i>now</i> because I feel it growing dull.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But "why then publish?"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_708">[708]</a>—There are no rewards</p>
					<p class="i2">Of fame or profit when the World grows weary.</p>
					<p>I ask in turn,—Why do you play at cards?</p>
					<p class="i2">Why drink? Why read?—To make some hour less dreary.</p>
					<p>It occupies me to turn back regards</p>
					<p class="i2">On what I've seen or pondered, sad or cheery;</p>
					<p>And what I write I cast upon the stream,</p>
					<p>To swim or sink—I have had at least my dream.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I think that were I <i>certain</i> of success,</p>
					<p class="i2">I hardly could compose another line:</p>
					<p>So long I've battled either more or less,</p>
					<p class="i2">That no defeat can drive me from the Nine.</p>
					<p>This feeling 't is not easy to express,</p>
					<p class="i2">And yet 't is not affected, I opine.</p>
					<p>In play, there are two pleasures for your choosing—</p>
					<p>The one is winning, and the other losing.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Besides, my Muse by no means deals in fiction:</p>
					<p class="i2">She gathers a repertory of facts,</p>
					<p>Of course with some reserve and slight restriction,</p>
					<p class="i2">But mostly sings of human things and acts—</p>
					<p>And that's one cause she meets with contradiction;</p>
					<p class="i2">For too much truth, at first sight, ne'er attracts;</p>
					<p>And were her object only what's called Glory,</p>
					<p>With more ease too she'd tell a different story.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Love—War—a tempest—surely there's variety;</p>
					<p class="i2">Also a seasoning slight of lucubration;</p>
					<p>A bird's-eye view, too, of that wild, Society;</p>
					<p class="i2">A slight glance thrown on men of every station.</p>
					<p>If you have nought else, here's at least satiety,</p>
					<p class="i2">Both in performance and in preparation;</p>
					<p>And though these lines should only line portmanteaus,</p>
					<p>Trade will be all the better for these Cantos.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The portion of this World which I at present</p>
					<p class="i2">Have taken up to fill the following sermon,</p>
					<p>Is one of which there's no description recent:</p>
					<p class="i2">The reason why is easy to determine:</p>
					<p>Although it seems both prominent and pleasant,</p>
					<p class="i2">There is a sameness in its gems and ermine,</p>
					<p>A dull and family likeness through all ages,</p>
					<p>Of no great promise for poetic pages.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>With much to excite, there's little to exalt;</p>
					<p class="i2">Nothing that speaks to all men and all times;</p>
					<p>A sort of varnish over every fault;</p>
					<p class="i2">A kind of common-place, even in their crimes;</p>
					<p>Factitious passions—Wit without much salt—</p>
					<p class="i2">A want of that true nature which sublimes</p>
					<p>Whate'er it shows with Truth; a smooth monotony</p>
					<p>Of character, in those at least who have got any.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Sometimes, indeed, like soldiers off parade,</p>
					<p class="i2">They break their ranks and gladly leave the drill;</p>
					<p>But then the roll-call draws them back afraid,</p>
					<p class="i2">And they must be or seem what they <i>were</i>: still</p>
					<p>Doubtless it is a brilliant masquerade:</p>
					<p class="i2">But when of the first sight you have had your fill,</p>
					<p>It palls—at least it did so upon me,</p>
					<p>This paradise of Pleasure and <i>Ennui</i>.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>When we have made our love, and gamed our gaming,</p>
					<p class="i2">Dressed, voted, shone, and, may be, something more—</p>
					<p>With dandies dined—heard senators declaiming—</p>
					<p class="i2">Seen beauties brought to market by the score,</p>
					<p>Sad rakes to sadder husbands chastely taming—</p>
					<p class="i2">There's little left but to be bored or bore.</p>
					<p>Witness those <i>ci-devant jeunes hommes</i> who stem</p>
					<p>The stream, nor leave the world which leaveth them.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>'T is said—indeed a general complaint—</p>
					<p class="i2">That no one has succeeded in describing</p>
					<p>The <i>monde</i>, exactly as they ought to paint:</p>
					<p class="i2">Some say, that authors only snatch, by bribing</p>
					<p>The porter, some slight scandals strange and quaint,</p>
					<p class="i2">To furnish matter for their moral gibing;</p>
					<p>And that their books have but one style in common—</p>
					<p>My Lady's prattle, filtered through her woman.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But this can't well be true, just now; for writers</p>
					<p class="i2">Are grown of the <i>beau monde</i> a part potential:</p>
					<p>I've seen them balance even the scale with fighters,</p>
					<p class="i2">Especially when young, for that's essential.</p>
					<p>Why do their sketches fail them as inditers</p>
					<p class="i2">Of what they deem themselves most consequential,</p>
					<p>The <i>real</i> portrait of the highest tribe?</p>
					<p>'T is that—in fact—there's little to describe.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p><i>"Haud ignara loquor;"</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_709">[709]</a> these are <i>Nugae</i>, "<i>quarum</i></p>
					<p class="i2"><i>Pars</i> parva <i>fui</i>," but still art and part.</p>
					<p>Now I could much more easily sketch a harem,</p>
					<p class="i2">A battle, wreck, or history of the heart,</p>
					<p>Than these things; and besides, I wish to spare 'em,</p>
					<p class="i2">For reasons which I choose to keep apart.</p>
					<p><i>"Vetabo Cereris sacrum qui vulgarit"</i>—<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_710">[710]</a></p>
					<p>Which means, that vulgar people must not share it.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And therefore what I throw off is ideal—</p>
					<p class="i2">Lowered, leavened, like a history of Freemasons,</p>
					<p>Which bears the same relation to the real,</p>
					<p class="i2">As Captain Parry's Voyage may do to Jason's.</p>
					<p>The grand <i>Arcanum</i>'s not for men to see all;</p>
					<p class="i2">My music has some mystic diapasons;</p>
					<p>And there is much which could not be appreciated</p>
					<p>In any manner by the uninitiated.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Alas! worlds fall—and Woman, since she felled</p>
					<p class="i2">The World (as, since that history, less polite</p>
					<p>Than true, hath been a creed so strictly held),</p>
					<p class="i2">Has not yet given up the practice quite.</p>
					<p>Poor Thing of Usages! coerced, compelled,</p>
					<p class="i2">Victim when wrong, and martyr oft when right,</p>
					<p>Condemned to child-bed, as men for their sins</p>
					<p>Have shaving too entailed upon their chins,—</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>A daily plague, which in the aggregate</p>
					<p class="i2">May average on the whole with parturition.—</p>
					<p>But as to women—who can penetrate</p>
					<p class="i2">The real sufferings of their she condition?</p>
					<p>Man's very sympathy with their estate</p>
					<p class="i2">Has much of selfishness, and more suspicion.</p>
					<p>Their love, their virtue, beauty, education,</p>
					<p>But form good housekeepers—to breed a nation.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>All this were very well, and can't be better;</p>
					<p class="i2">But even this is difficult, Heaven knows,</p>
					<p>So many troubles from her birth beset her,</p>
					<p class="i2">Such small distinction between friends and foes;</p>
					<p>The gilding wears so soon from off her fetter,</p>
					<p class="i2">That—but ask any woman if she'd choose</p>
					<p>(Take her at thirty, that is) to have been</p>
					<p>Female or male? a schoolboy or a Queen?</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"Petticoat Influence" is a great reproach,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which even those who obey would fain be thought</p>
					<p>To fly from, as from hungry pikes a roach;</p>
					<p class="i2">But since beneath it upon earth we are brought,</p>
					<p>By various joltings of Life's hackney coach,</p>
					<p class="i2">I for one venerate a petticoat—</p>
					<p>A garment of a mystical sublimity,</p>
					<p>No matter whether russet, silk, or dimity.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_MV">[MV]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Much I respect, and much I have adored,</p>
					<p class="i2">In my young days, that chaste and goodly veil,</p>
					<p>Which holds a treasure, like a miser's hoard,</p>
					<p class="i2">And more attracts by all it doth conceal—</p>
					<p>A golden scabbard on a Damasque sword,</p>
					<p class="i2">A loving letter with a mystic seal,</p>
					<p>A cure for grief—for what can ever rankle</p>
					<p>Before a petticoat and peeping ankle?</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And when upon a silent, sullen day,</p>
					<p class="i2">With a Sirocco, for example, blowing,</p>
					<p>When even the sea looks dim with all its spray,</p>
					<p class="i2">And sulkily the river's ripple's flowing,</p>
					<p>And the sky shows that very ancient gray,</p>
					<p class="i2">The sober, sad antithesis to glowing,—</p>
					<p>'T is pleasant, if <i>then</i> anything is pleasant,</p>
					<p>To catch a glimpse even of a pretty peasant.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>We left our heroes and our heroines</p>
					<p class="i2">In that fair clime which don't depend on climate,</p>
					<p>Quite independent of the Zodiac's signs,</p>
					<p class="i2">Though certainly more difficult to rhyme at,</p>
					<p>Because the Sun, and stars, and aught that shines,</p>
					<p class="i2">Mountains, and all we can be most sublime at,</p>
					<p>Are there oft dull and dreary as a <i>dun</i>—</p>
					<p>Whether a sky's or tradesman's is all one.</p>

			<h3>XXX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>An in-door life is less poetical;</p>
					<p class="i2">And out-of-door hath showers, and mists, and sleet</p>
					<p>With which I could not brew a pastoral:</p>
					<p class="i2">But be it as it may, a bard must meet</p>
					<p>All difficulties, whether great or small,</p>
					<p class="i2">To spoil his undertaking, or complete—</p>
					<p>And work away—like Spirit upon Matter—</p>
					<p>Embarrassed somewhat both with fire and water.</p>

			<h3>XXXI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Juan—in this respect, at least, like saints—</p>
					<p class="i2">Was all things unto people of all sorts,</p>
					<p>And lived contentedly, without complaints,</p>
					<p class="i2">In camps, in ships, in cottages, or courts—</p>
					<p>Born with that happy soul which seldom faints,</p>
					<p class="i2">And mingling modestly in toils or sports.</p>
					<p>He likewise could be most things to all women,</p>
					<p>Without the coxcombry of certain <i>she</i> men.</p>

			<h3>XXXII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>A fox-hunt to a foreigner is strange;</p>
					<p class="i2">'T is also subject to the double danger</p>
					<p>Of tumbling first, and having in exchange</p>
					<p class="i2">Some pleasant jesting at the awkward stranger:</p>
					<p>But Juan had been early taught to range</p>
					<p class="i2">The wilds, as doth an Arab turned avenger,</p>

					<p class="i2">And only fretted when the scent 'gan fail.</p>
					<p>He broke, 't is true, some statutes of the laws</p>

					<p>The Nestors of the sporting generation,</p>
					<p class="i2">Swore praises, and recalled their former fires;</p>
					<p>The Huntsman's self relented to a grin,</p>

					<p>Now grave, now gay, but never dull or pert;</p>
					<p class="i2">And smiling but in secret—cunning rogue!</p>
