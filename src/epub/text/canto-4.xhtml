			<h3>I.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Nothing so difficult as a beginning</p>
					<p class="i2">In poesy, unless perhaps the end;</p>
					<p>For oftentimes when Pegasus seems winning</p>
					<p class="i2">The race, he sprains a wing, and down we tend,</p>
					<p>Like Lucifer when hurled from Heaven for sinning;</p>
					<p class="i2">Our sin the same, and hard as his to mend,</p>
					<p>Being Pride,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_230">[230]</a> which leads the mind to soar too far,</p>
					<p>Till our own weakness shows us what we are.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>II.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But Time, which brings all beings to their level,</p>
					<p class="i2">And sharp Adversity, will teach at last</p>
					<p>Man,—and, as we would hope,—perhaps the Devil,</p>
					<p class="i2">That neither of their intellects are vast:</p>
					<p>While Youth's hot wishes in our red veins revel,</p>
					<p class="i2">We know not this—the blood flows on too fast;</p>
					<p>But as the torrent widens towards the Ocean,</p>
					<p>We ponder deeply on each past emotion.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_231">[231]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>III.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>As boy, I thought myself a clever fellow,</p>
					<p class="i2">And wished that others held the same opinion;</p>
					<p>They took it up when my days grew more mellow,</p>
					<p class="i2">And other minds acknowledged my dominion:</p>
					<p>Now my sere Fancy "falls into the yellow</p>
					<p class="i2">Leaf,"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_232">[232]</a> and Imagination droops her pinion,</p>
					<p>And the sad truth which hovers o'er my desk</p>
					<p>Turns what was once romantic to burlesque.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And if I laugh at any mortal thing,</p>
					<p class="i2">'T is that I may not weep; and if I weep,</p>
					<p>'T is that our nature cannot always bring</p>
					<p class="i2">Itself to apathy, for we must steep<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_DH">[DH]</a></p>
					<p>Our hearts first in the depths of Lethe's spring,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_DI">[DI]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Ere what we least wish to behold will sleep:</p>
					<p>Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx;</p>
					<p>A mortal mother would on Lethe fix.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>V.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Some have accused me of a strange design</p>
					<p class="i2">Against the creed and morals of the land,</p>
					<p>And trace it in this poem every line:</p>
					<p class="i2">I don't pretend that I quite understand</p>
					<p>My own meaning when I would be <i>very</i> fine;</p>
					<p class="i2">But the fact is that I have nothing planned,</p>
					<p>Unless it were to be a moment merry—</p>
					<p>A novel word in my vocabulary.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>To the kind reader of our sober clime</p>
					<p class="i2">This way of writing will appear exotic;</p>
					<p>Pulci<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_233">[233]</a> was sire of the half-serious rhyme,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_DJ">[DJ]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Who sang when Chivalry was more quixotic,</p>
					<p>And revelled in the fancies of the time,</p>
					<p class="i2">True Knights, chaste Dames, huge Giants, Kings despotic;</p>
					<p>But all these, save the last, being obsolete,</p>
					<p>I chose a modern subject as more meet.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>How I have treated it, I do not know;</p>
					<p class="i2">Perhaps no better than <i>they</i> have treated me,</p>
					<p>Who have imputed such designs as show</p>
					<p class="i2">Not what they saw, but what they wished to see:</p>
					<p>But if it gives them pleasure, be it so;</p>
					<p class="i2">This is a liberal age, and thoughts are free:</p>
					<p>Meantime Apollo plucks me by the ear,</p>
					<p>And tells me to resume my story here.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_234">[234]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Young Juan and his lady-love were left</p>
					<p class="i2">To their own hearts' most sweet society;</p>
					<p>Even Time the pitiless in sorrow cleft</p>
					<p class="i2">With his rude scythe such gentle bosoms; he</p>
					<p>Sighed to behold them of their hours bereft,</p>
					<p class="i2">Though foe to Love; and yet they could not be</p>
					<p>Meant to grow old, but die in happy Spring,</p>
					<p>Before one charm or hope had taken wing.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Their faces were not made for wrinkles, their</p>
					<p class="i2">Pure blood to stagnate, their great hearts to fail;</p>
					<p>The blank grey was not made to blast their hair,</p>
					<p class="i2">But like the climes that know nor snow nor hail,</p>
					<p>They were all summer; lightning might assail</p>
					<p class="i2">And shiver them to ashes, but to trail</p>
					<p>A long and snake-like life of dull decay</p>
					<p>Was not for them—they had too little clay.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>X.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>They were alone once more; for them to be</p>
					<p class="i2">Thus was another Eden; they were never</p>
					<p>Weary, unless when separate: the tree</p>
					<p class="i2">Cut from its forest root of years—the river</p>
					<p>Dammed from its fountain—the child from the knee</p>
					<p class="i2">And breast maternal weaned at once for ever,—</p>
					<p>Would wither less than these two torn apart;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_DK">[DK]</a></p>
					<p>Alas! there is no instinct like the Heart—</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The Heart—which may be broken: happy they!</p>
					<p class="i2">Thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,</p>
					<p>The precious porcelain of human clay,</p>
					<p class="i2">Break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold</p>
					<p>The long year linked with heavy day on day,</p>
					<p class="i2">And all which must be borne, and never told;</p>
					<p>While Life's strange principle will often lie</p>
					<p>Deepest in those who long the most to die.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"Whom the gods love die young," was said of yore,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_235">[235]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">And many deaths do they escape by this:</p>
					<p>The death of friends, and that which slays even more—</p>
					<p class="i2">The death of Friendship, Love, Youth, all that is,</p>
					<p>Except mere breath; and since the silent shore</p>
					<p class="i2">Awaits at last even those who longest miss</p>
					<p>The old Archer's shafts, perhaps the early grave<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_236">[236]</a></p>
					<p>Which men weep over may be meant to save.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Haidée and Juan thought not of the dead—</p>
					<p class="i2">The Heavens, and Earth, and Air, seemed made for them:</p>
					<p>They found no fault with Time, save that he fled;</p>
					<p class="i2">They saw not in themselves aught to condemn:</p>
					<p>Each was the other's mirror, and but read</p>
					<p class="i2">Joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem.</p>
					<p>And knew such brightness was but the reflection</p>
					<p>Of their exchanging glances of affection.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The gentle pressure, and the thrilling touch,</p>
					<p class="i2">The least glance better understood than words,</p>
					<p>Which still said all, and ne'er could say too much;</p>
					<p class="i2">A language,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_237">[237]</a> too, but like to that of birds,</p>
					<p>Known but to them, at least appearing such</p>
					<p class="i2">As but to lovers a true sense affords;</p>
					<p>Sweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd</p>
					<p>To those who have ceased to hear such, or ne'er heard—</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>All these were theirs, for they were children still,</p>
					<p class="i2">And children still they should have ever been;</p>
					<p>They were not made in the real world to fill</p>
					<p class="i2">A busy character in the dull scene,</p>
					<p>But like two beings born from out a rill,</p>
					<p class="i2">A Nymph and her belovéd, all unseen</p>
					<p>To pass their lives in fountains and on flowers,</p>
					<p>And never know the weight of human hours.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Moons changing had rolled on, and changeless found</p>
					<p class="i2">Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys</p>
					<p>As rarely they beheld throughout their round;</p>
					<p class="i2">And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,</p>
					<p>For theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound</p>
					<p class="i2">By the mere senses; and that which destroys<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_DL">[DL]</a></p>
					<p>Most love—possession—unto them appeared</p>
					<p>A thing which each endearment more endeared.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Oh beautiful! and rare as beautiful!</p>
					<p class="i2">But theirs was Love in which the Mind delights</p>
					<p>To lose itself, when the old world grows dull,</p>
					<p class="i2">And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,</p>
					<p>Intrigues, adventures of the common school,</p>
					<p class="i2">Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,</p>
					<p>Where Hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,</p>
					<p>Whose husband only knows her not a whore.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Hard words—harsh truth! a truth which many know.</p>
					<p class="i2">Enough.—The faithful and the fairy pair,</p>
					<p>Who never found a single hour too slow,</p>
					<p class="i2">What was it made them thus exempt from care?</p>
					<p>Young innate feelings all have felt below,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which perish in the rest, but in them were</p>
					<p>Inherent—what we mortals call romantic,</p>
					<p>And always envy, though we deem it frantic.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>This is in others a factitious state,</p>
					<p class="i2">An opium dream<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_238">[238]</a> of too much youth and reading,</p>
					<p>But was in them their nature or their fate:</p>
					<p class="i2">No novels e'er had set their young hearts bleeding,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_DM">[DM]</a></p>
					<p>For Haidée's knowledge was by no means great,</p>
					<p class="i2">And Juan was a boy of saintly breeding;</p>
					<p>So that there was no reason for their loves</p>
					<p>More than for those of nightingales or doves.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>They gazed upon the sunset; 't is an hour</p>
					<p class="i2">Dear unto all, but dearest to <i>their</i> eyes,</p>
					<p>For it had made them what they were: the power</p>
					<p class="i2">Of Love had first o'erwhelmed them from such skies,</p>
					<p>When Happiness had been their only dower,</p>
					<p class="i2">And Twilight saw them linked in Passion's ties;</p>
					<p>Charmed with each other, all things charmed that brought</p>
					<p>The past still welcome as the present thought.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I know not why, but in that hour to-night,</p>
					<p class="i2">Even as they gazed, a sudden tremor came,</p>
					<p>And swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,</p>
					<p class="i2">Like the wind o'er a harp-string, or a flame,</p>
					<p>When one is shook in sound, and one in sight:</p>
					<p class="i2">And thus some boding flashed through either frame,</p>
					<p>And called from Juan's breast a faint low sigh,</p>
					<p>While one new tear arose in Haidée's eye.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>That large black prophet eye seemed to dilate</p>
					<p class="i2">And follow far the disappearing sun,</p>
					<p>As if their last day of a happy date</p>
					<p class="i2">With his broad, bright, and dropping orb were gone;</p>
					<p>Juan gazed on her as to ask his fate—</p>
					<p class="i2">He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,</p>
					<p>His glance inquired of hers for some excuse</p>
					<p>For feelings causeless, or at least abstruse.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>She turned to him, and smiled, but in that sort</p>
					<p class="i2">Which makes not others smile; then turned aside:</p>
					<p>Whatever feeling shook her, it seemed short,</p>
					<p class="i2">And mastered by her wisdom or her pride;</p>
					<p>When Juan spoke, too—it might be in sport—</p>
					<p class="i2">Of this their mutual feeling, she replied—</p>
					<p>"If it should be so,—but—it cannot be—</p>
					<p>Or I at least shall not survive to see."</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Juan would question further, but she pressed</p>
					<p class="i2">His lip to hers, and silenced him with this,</p>
					<p>And then dismissed the omen from her breast,</p>
					<p class="i2">Defying augury with that fond kiss;</p>
					<p>And no doubt of all methods 't is the best:</p>
					<p class="i2">Some people prefer wine—'t is not amiss;</p>
					<p>I have tried both—so those who would a part take</p>
					<p>May choose between the headache and the heartache.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>One of the two, according to your choice,</p>
					<p class="i2">Woman or wine, you'll have to undergo;</p>
					<p>Both maladies are taxes on our joys:</p>
					<p class="i2">But which to choose, I really hardly know;</p>
					<p>And if I had to give a casting voice,</p>
					<p class="i2">For both sides I could many reasons show,</p>
					<p>And then decide, without great wrong to either,</p>
					<p>It were much better to have both than neither.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Juan and Haidée gazed upon each other</p>
					<p class="i2">With swimming looks of speechless tenderness,</p>
					<p>Which mixed all feelings—friend, child, lover, brother—</p>
					<p class="i2">All that the best can mingle and express</p>
					<p>When two pure hearts are poured in one another,</p>
					<p class="i2">And love too much, and yet can not love less;</p>
					<p>But almost sanctify the sweet excess</p>
					<p>By the immortal wish and power to bless.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Mixed in each other's arms, and heart in heart,</p>
					<p class="i2">Why did they not then die?—they had lived too long</p>
					<p>Should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;</p>
					<p class="i2">Years could but bring them cruel things or wrong;</p>
					<p>The World was not for them—nor the World's art</p>
					<p class="i2">For beings passionate as Sappho's song;</p>
					<p>Love was born <i>with</i> them, <i>in</i> them, so intense,</p>
					<p>It was their very Spirit—not a sense.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>They should have lived together deep in woods,</p>
					<p class="i2">Unseen as sings the nightingale;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_239">[239]</a> they were</p>
					<p>Unfit to mix in these thick solitudes</p>
					<p class="i2">Called social, haunts of Hate, and Vice, and Care:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_DN">[DN]</a></p>
					<p>How lonely every freeborn creature broods!</p>
					<p class="i2">The sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;</p>
					<p>The eagle soars alone; the gull and crow</p>
					<p>Flock o'er their carrion, just like men below.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Now pillowed cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,</p>
					<p class="i2">Haidée and Juan their siesta took,</p>
					<p>A gentle slumber, but it was not deep,</p>
					<p class="i2">For ever and anon a something shook</p>
					<p>Juan, and shuddering o'er his frame would creep;</p>
					<p class="i2">And Haidée's sweet lips murmured like a brook</p>
					<p>A wordless music, and her face so fair</p>
					<p>Stirred with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_DO">[DO]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Or as the stirring of a deep clear stream</p>
					<p class="i2">Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind</p>
					<p>Walks o'er it, was she shaken by the dream,</p>
					<p class="i2">The mystical Usurper of the mind—</p>
					<p>O'erpowering us to be whate'er may seem</p>
					<p class="i2">Good to the soul which we no more can bind;</p>
					<p>Strange state of being! (for 't is still to be)</p>
					<p>Senseless to feel, and with sealed eyes to see.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_DP">[DP]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>She dreamed of being alone on the sea-shore,</p>
					<p class="i2">Chained to a rock; she knew not how, but stir</p>
					<p>She could not from the spot, and the loud roar</p>
					<p class="i2">Grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;</p>
					<p>And o'er her upper lip they seemed to pour,</p>
					<p class="i2">Until she sobbed for breath, and soon they were</p>
					<p>Foaming o'er her lone head, so fierce and high—</p>
					<p>Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Anon—she was released, and then she strayed</p>
					<p class="i2">O'er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,</p>
					<p>And stumbled almost every step she made:</p>
					<p class="i2">And something rolled before her in a sheet,</p>
					<p>Which she must still pursue howe'er afraid:</p>
					<p class="i2">'T was white and indistinct, nor stopped to meet</p>
					<p>Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed and grasped,</p>
					<p>And ran, but it escaped her as she clasped.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The dream changed:—in a cave<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_240">[240]</a> she stood, its walls</p>
					<p class="i2">Were hung with marble icicles; the work</p>
					<p>Of ages on its water-fretted halls,</p>
					<p class="i2">Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;</p>
					<p>Her hair was dripping, and the very balls</p>
					<p class="i2">Of her black eyes seemed turned to tears, and mirk</p>
					<p>The sharp rocks looked below each drop they caught,</p>
					<p>Which froze to marble as it fell,—she thought.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_DQ">[DQ]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,</p>
					<p class="i2">Pale as the foam that frothed on his dead brow,</p>
					<p>Which she essayed in vain to clear, (how sweet</p>
					<p class="i2">Were once her cares, how idle seemed they now!)</p>
					<p>Lay Juan, nor could aught renew the beat</p>
					<p class="i2">Of his quenched heart: and the sea dirges low</p>
					<p>Rang in her sad ears like a Mermaid's song,</p>
					<p>And that brief dream appeared a life too long.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And gazing on the dead, she thought his face</p>
					<p class="i2">Faded, or altered into something new—</p>
					<p>Like to her Father's features, till each trace</p>
					<p class="i2">More like and like to Lambro's aspect grew—</p>
					<p>With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;</p>
					<p class="i2">And starting, she awoke, and what to view?</p>
					<p>Oh! Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she there?</p>
					<p>'T is—'t is her Father's—fixed upon the pair!</p>

			<h3>XXXVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,</p>
					<p class="i2">With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see</p>
					<p>Him whom she deemed a habitant where dwell</p>

					<p>Perchance the death of one she loved too well:</p>
					<p class="i2">Dear as her father had been to Haidée,</p>

			<h3>XXXVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Up Juan sprang to Haidée's bitter shriek,</p>
					<p class="i2">And caught her falling, and from off the wall</p>
					<p>Snatched down his sabre, in hot haste to wreak</p>
					<p class="i2">Vengeance on him who was the cause of all:</p>
					<p>Then Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,</p>
					<p class="i2">Smiled scornfully, and said, "Within my call,</p>
					<p>A thousand scimitars await the word;</p>
					<p>Put up, young man, put up your silly sword."</p>

			<h3>XXXVIII.</h3>

					<p>Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars</p>
					<p class="i2">For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,</p>
					<p>Warranted virgin; Beauty's brightest colours</p>
					<p class="i2">Had decked her out in all the hues of heaven:</p>
					<p>Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,</p>
					<p class="i2">Who bade on till the hundreds reached eleven;</p>
					<p>But when the offer went beyond, they knew</p>
					<p>'T was for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.</p>

					<p>Twelve negresses from Nubia brought a price</p>
					<p class="i2">Which the West Indian market scarce could bring—</p>
					<p>Though Wilberforce, at last, has made it twice</p>
					<p class="i2">What 't was ere Abolition; and the thing</p>
					<p>Need not seem very wonderful, for Vice</p>
					<p class="i2">Is always much more splendid than a King:</p>
					<p>The Virtues, even the most exalted, Charity,</p>
					<p>Are saving—Vice spares nothing for a rarity.</p>

					<p>But for the destiny of this young troop,</p>
					<p class="i2">How some were bought by Pachas, some by Jews,</p>
					<p>How some to burdens were obliged to stoop,</p>
					<p class="i2">And others rose to the command of crews</p>
					<p>As renegadoes; while in hapless group,</p>
					<p class="i2">Hoping no very old Vizier might choose,</p>
					<p>The females stood, as one by one they picked 'em,</p>
					<p>To make a mistress, or fourth wife, or victim:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_ER">[ER]</a></p>

					<p>All this must be reserved for further song;</p>
					<p class="i2">Also our Hero's lot, howe'er unpleasant</p>
					<p>(Because this Canto has become too long),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_ES">[ES]</a></p>

					<p>I'm sensible redundancy is wrong,</p>

					<p>And now delay the progress of Don Juan,</p>
					<p>Till what is called in Ossian the fifth Duan.</p>
