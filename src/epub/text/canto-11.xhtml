					<p>When Bishop Berkeley said "there was no matter,"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_562">[562]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">And proved it—'t was no matter what he said:</p>
					<p>They say his system 't is in vain to batter,</p>
					<p class="i2">Too subtle for the airiest human head;</p>
					<p>And yet who can believe it? I would shatter</p>
					<p class="i2">Gladly all matters down to stone or lead,</p>
					<p>Or adamant, to find the World a spirit,</p>
					<p>And wear my head, denying that I wear it.</p>

					<p>What a sublime discovery 't was to make the</p>

					<p>That all's ideal—<i>all ourselves!</i>—I'll stake the</p>

					<p>Oh Doubt!—if thou be'st Doubt, for which some take thee,</p>
					<p class="i2">But which I doubt extremely—thou sole prism</p>
					<p>Of the Truth's rays, spoil not my draught of spirit!</p>
					<p>Heaven's brandy, though our brain can hardly bear it.</p>

					<p>For ever and anon comes Indigestion</p>
					<p class="i2">(Not the most "dainty Ariel"),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_563">[563]</a> and perplexes</p>
					<p>Our soarings with another sort of question:</p>
					<p class="i2">And that which after all my spirit vexes,</p>
					<p>Is, that I find no spot where Man can rest eye on,</p>
					<p class="i2">Without confusion of the sorts and sexes,</p>
					<p>Of Beings, Stars, and this unriddled wonder,</p>
					<p>The World, which at the worst's a <i>glorious</i> blunder—</p>

					<p>If it be chance—or, if it be according</p>
					<p class="i2">To the old text, still better:—lest it should</p>
					<p>Turn out so, we 'll say nothing 'gainst the wording,</p>
					<p class="i2">As several people think such hazards rude.</p>
					<p>They're right; our days are too brief for affording</p>
					<p class="i2">Space to dispute what <i>no one</i> ever could</p>
					<p>Decide, and <i>everybody one day</i> will</p>
					<p>Know very clearly—or at least lie still.</p>

			<h3>V.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And therefore will I leave off metaphysical</p>
					<p class="i2">Discussion, which is neither here nor there:</p>
					<p>If I agree that what is, is; then this I call</p>
					<p class="i2">Being quite perspicuous and extremely fair;</p>
					<p>The truth is, I've grown lately rather phthisical:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_564">[564]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">I don't know what the reason is—the air</p>
					<p>Perhaps; but as I suffer from the shocks</p>
					<p>Of illness, I grow much more orthodox.</p>

			<h3>VI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The first attack at once proved the Divinity</p>

					<p>The next, the Virgin's mystical virginity;</p>
					<p class="i2">The third, the usual Origin of Evil;</p>
					<p>The fourth at once established the whole Trinity</p>
					<p class="i2">On so uncontrovertible a level,</p>
					<p>That I devoutly wished the three were four—</p>
					<p>On purpose to believe so much the more.</p>

					<p>To our theme.—The man who has stood on the Acropolis,</p>
					<p class="i2">And looked down over Attica; or he</p>
					<p>Who has sailed where picturesque Constantinople is,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or seen Timbuctoo, or hath taken tea</p>
					<p>In small-eyed China's crockery-ware metropolis,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or sat amidst the bricks of Nineveh,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_KK">[KK]</a></p>

			<h3>VIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Don Juan had got out on Shooter's Hill;</p>
					<p class="i2">Sunset the time, the place the same declivity</p>
					<p>Which looks along that vale of Good and Ill</p>
					<p class="i2">Where London streets ferment in full activity,</p>
					<p>While everything around was calm and still,</p>
					<p class="i2">Except the creak of wheels, which on their pivot he</p>
					<p>Heard,—and that bee-like, bubbling, busy hum</p>
					<p>Of cities, that boil over with their scum:—</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I say, Don Juan, wrapped in contemplation,</p>
					<p class="i2">Walked on behind his carriage, o'er the summit,</p>
					<p>And lost in wonder of so great a nation,</p>
					<p class="i2">Gave way to 't, since he could not overcome it.</p>
					<p>"And here," he cried, "is Freedom's chosen station;</p>
					<p class="i2">Here peals the People's voice, nor can entomb it</p>
					<p>Racks—prisons—inquisitions; Resurrection</p>
					<p>Awaits it, each new meeting or election.</p>

			<h3>X.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"Here are chaste wives, pure lives; here people pay</p>
					<p class="i2">But what they please; and if that things be dear,</p>
					<p>'T is only that they love to throw away</p>
					<p class="i2">Their cash, to show how much they have a-year.</p>
					<p>Here laws are all inviolate—none lay</p>
					<p class="i2">Traps for the traveller—every highway's clear—</p>
					<p>Here"—he was interrupted by a knife,</p>
					<p>With—"Damn your eyes! your money or your life!"—</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>These free-born sounds proceeded from four pads</p>
					<p class="i2">In ambush laid, who had perceived him loiter</p>
					<p>Behind his carriage; and, like handy lads,</p>
					<p class="i2">Had seized the lucky hour to reconnoitre,</p>
					<p>In which the heedless gentleman who gads</p>
					<p class="i2">Upon the road, unless he prove a fighter,</p>
					<p>May find himself within that isle of riches</p>
					<p>Exposed to lose his life as well as breeches.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Juan, who did not understand a word</p>
					<p class="i2">Of English, save their shibboleth, "God damn!"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_565">[565]</a></p>
					<p>And even that he had so rarely heard,</p>
					<p class="i2">He sometimes thought 't was only their "Salām,"</p>
					<p>Or "God be with you!"—and 't is not absurd</p>
					<p class="i2">To think so,—for half English as I am</p>
					<p>(To my misfortune), never can I say</p>
					<p>I heard them wish "God with you," save that way;—</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Juan yet quickly understood their gesture,</p>
					<p class="i2">And being somewhat choleric and sudden,</p>
					<p>Drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture,</p>
					<p class="i2">And fired it into one assailant's pudding—</p>
					<p>Who fell, as rolls an ox o'er in his pasture,</p>
					<p class="i2">And roared out, as he writhed his native mud in,</p>
					<p>Unto his nearest follower or henchman,</p>
					<p>"Oh Jack! I'm floored by that 'ere bloody Frenchman!"</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>On which Jack and his train set off at speed,</p>
					<p class="i2">And Juan's suite, late scattered at a distance,</p>
					<p>Came up, all marvelling at such a deed,</p>
					<p class="i2">And offering, as usual, late assistance.</p>
					<p>Juan, who saw the moon's late minion<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_566">[566]</a> bleed</p>
					<p class="i2">As if his veins would pour out his existence,</p>
					<p>Stood calling out for bandages and lint,</p>
					<p>And wished he had been less hasty with his flint.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"Perhaps," thought he, "it is the country's wont</p>
					<p class="i2">To welcome foreigners in this way: now</p>
					<p>I recollect some innkeepers who don't</p>
					<p class="i2">Differ, except in robbing with a bow,</p>
					<p>In lieu of a bare blade and brazen front—</p>
					<p class="i2">But what is to be done? I can't allow</p>
					<p>The fellow to lie groaning on the road:</p>
					<p>So take him up—I'll help you with the load."</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But ere they could perform this pious duty,</p>
					<p class="i2">The dying man cried, "Hold! I've got my gruel!</p>
					<p>Oh! for a glass of <i>max</i>!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_567">[567]</a> We've missed our booty;</p>
					<p class="i2">Let me die where I am!" And as the fuel</p>
					<p>Of Life shrunk in his heart, and thick and sooty</p>
					<p class="i2">The drops fell from his death-wound, and he drew ill</p>
					<p>His breath,—he from his swelling throat untied</p>
					<p>A kerchief, crying, "Give Sal that!"—and died.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The cravat stained with bloody drops fell down</p>
					<p class="i2">Before Don Juan's feet: he could not tell</p>
					<p>Exactly why it was before him thrown,</p>
					<p class="i2">Nor what the meaning of the man's farewell.</p>
					<p>Poor Tom was once a kiddy upon town,</p>
					<p class="i2">A thorough varmint, and a <i>real</i> swell,</p>
					<p>Full flash,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_568">[568]</a> all fancy, until fairly diddled,</p>
					<p>His pockets first and then his body riddled.</p>

			<h3>XVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Don Juan, having done the best he could</p>
					<p class="i2">In all the circumstances of the case,</p>
					<p>As soon as "Crowner's quest"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_569">[569]</a> allowed, pursued</p>
					<p class="i2">His travels to the capital apace;—</p>
					<p>Esteeming it a little hard he should</p>
					<p class="i2">In twelve hours' time, and very little space,</p>
					<p>Have been obliged to slay a free-born native</p>
					<p>In self-defence: this made him meditative.</p>

				<div class="stanza">
					<p>He from the world had cut off a great man,</p>

					<p>Who queer a flat?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_570">[570]</a> Who (spite of Bow-street's ban)</p>
					<p class="i2">On the high toby-spice so flash the muzzle?</p>

					<p class="i2">Hail! Thamis, hail! Upon thy verge it is</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Through this, and much, and more, is the approach</p>
					<p class="i2">Of travellers to mighty Babylon:</p>

					<p class="i2">With slight exceptions, all the ways seem one.</p>
					<p>I could say more, but do not choose to encroach</p>
					<p class="i2">Upon the Guide-book's privilege. The Sun</p>

					<p>That's rather fine, the gentle sound of Thamis—</p>

					<p>Though hardly heard through multifarious "damme's:"</p>
					<p class="i2">The lamps of Westminster's more regular gleam,</p>
					<p>The breadth of pavement, and yon shrine where Fame is</p>
					<p class="i2">A spectral resident—whose pallid beam</p>
					<p>In shape of moonshine hovers o'er the pile—</p>

					<p>The Druids' groves are gone—so much the better:</p>

					<p>But Bedlam still exists with its sage fetter,</p>
					<p class="i2">That madmen may not bite you on a visit;</p>
					<p>The Bench too seats or suits full many a debtor;</p>
					<p class="i2">The Mansion House,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_575">[575]</a> too (though some people quiz it),</p>

					<p>The line of lights,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_576">[576]</a> too, up to Charing Cross,</p>

					<p>Like gold as in comparison to dross,</p>

					<p>Whose cities Night by no means deigns to gloss.</p>
					<p class="i2">The French were not yet a lamp-lighting nation,</p>
