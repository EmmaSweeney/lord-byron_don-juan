			<h3>I.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The antique Persians taught three useful things,</p>
					<p class="i2">To draw the bow, to ride, and speak the truth,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_769">[769]</a></p>
					<p>This was the mode of Cyrus, best of kings—</p>
					<p class="i2">A mode adopted since by modern youth.</p>
					<p>Bows have they, generally with two strings;</p>
					<p class="i2">Horses they ride without remorse or ruth;</p>
					<p>At speaking truth perhaps they are less clever,</p>
					<p>But draw the long bow better now than ever.</p>
				</div>

			<h3>II.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The cause of this effect, or this defect,—</p>
					<p class="i2">"For this effect defective comes by cause,"—<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_770">[770]</a></p>
					<p>Is what I have not leisure to inspect;</p>
					<p class="i2">But this I must say in my own applause,</p>
					<p>Of all the Muses that I recollect,</p>
					<p class="i2">Whate'er may be her follies or her flaws</p>
					<p>In some things, mine's beyond all contradiction</p>
					<p>The most sincere that ever dealt in fiction.</p>
				</div>

			<h3>III.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And as she treats all things, and ne'er retreats</p>
					<p class="i2">From anything, this Epic will contain</p>
					<p>A wilderness of the most rare conceits,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which you might elsewhere hope to find in vain.</p>
					<p>'Tis true there be some bitters with the sweets,</p>
					<p class="i2">Yet mixed so slightly, that you can't complain,</p>
					<p>But wonder they so few are, since my tale is</p>
					<p>"<i>De rebus cunctis et quibusdam aliis.</i>"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_771">[771]</a></p>

			<h3>IV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But of all truths which she has told, the most</p>
					<p class="i2">True is that which she is about to tell.</p>
					<p>I said it was a story of a ghost—</p>
					<p class="i2">What then? I only know it so befell.</p>
					<p>Have you explored the limits of the coast,</p>
					<p class="i2">Where all the dwellers of the earth must dwell?</p>
					<p>'Tis time to strike such puny doubters dumb as</p>
					<p>The sceptics who would not believe Columbus.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>V.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Some people would impose now with authority,</p>
					<p class="i2">Turpin's or Monmouth Geoffry's Chronicle;</p>
					<p>Men whose historical superiority</p>
					<p class="i2">Is always greatest at a miracle.</p>
					<p>But Saint Augustine has the great priority,</p>
					<p class="i2">Who bids all men believe the impossible,</p>
					<p><i>Because 'tis so.</i> Who nibble, scribble, quibble, he</p>
					<p>Quiets at once with "<i>quia impossibile.</i>"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_772">[772]</a></p>

			</div>
			<h3>VI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And therefore, mortals, cavil not at all;</p>
					<p class="i2">Believe:—if 'tis improbable, you <i>must</i>,</p>
					<p>And if it is impossible, you <i>shall</i>:</p>
					<p class="i2">'Tis always best to take things upon trust.</p>
					<p>I do not speak profanely to recall</p>
					<p class="i2">Those holier Mysteries which the wise and just</p>
					<p>Receive as Gospel, and which grow more rooted,</p>
					<p>As all truths must, the more they are disputed:</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I merely mean to say what Johnson said,</p>
					<p class="i2">That in the course of some six thousand years,</p>
					<p>All nations have believed that from the dead</p>
					<p class="i2">A visitant at intervals appears:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_773">[773]</a></p>
					<p>And what is strangest upon this strange head,</p>
					<p class="i2">Is, that whatever bar the reason rears</p>
					<p>'Gainst such belief, there's something stronger still</p>
					<p>In its behalf—let those deny who will.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The dinner and the <i>soirée</i> too were done,</p>
					<p class="i2">The supper too discussed, the dames admired,</p>
					<p>The banqueteers had dropped off one by one—</p>
					<p class="i2">The song was silent, and the dance expired:</p>
					<p>The last thin petticoats were vanished, gone</p>
					<p class="i2">Like fleecy clouds into the sky retired,</p>
					<p>And nothing brighter gleamed through the saloon</p>
					<p>Than dying tapers—and the peeping moon.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The evaporation of a joyous day</p>
					<p class="i2">Is like the last glass of champagne, without</p>
					<p>The foam which made its virgin bumper gay;</p>
					<p class="i2">Or like a system coupled with a doubt;</p>
					<p>Or like a soda bottle when its spray</p>
					<p class="i2">Has sparkled and let half its spirit out;</p>
					<p>Or like a billow left by storms behind,</p>
					<p>Without the animation of the wind;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>X.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Or like an opiate, which brings troubled rest,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or none; or like—like nothing that I know</p>
					<p>Except itself;—such is the human breast;</p>
					<p class="i2">A thing, of which similitudes can show</p>
					<p>No real likeness,—like the old Tyrian vest</p>
					<p class="i2">Dyed purple, none at present can tell how,</p>
					<p>If from a shell-fish or from cochineal.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_774">[774]</a></p>
					<p>So perish every Tyrant's robe piece-meal!</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But next to dressing for a rout or ball,</p>
					<p class="i2">Undressing is a woe; our <i>robe de chambre</i></p>
					<p>May sit like that of Nessus,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_775">[775]</a> and recall</p>
					<p class="i2">Thoughts quite as yellow, but less clear than amber.</p>
					<p>Titus exclaimed, "I've lost a day!"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_776">[776]</a> Of all</p>
					<p class="i2">The nights and days most people can remember,</p>
					<p>(I have had of both, some not to be disdained,)</p>
					<p>I wish they'd state how many they have gained.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And Juan, on retiring for the night,</p>
					<p class="i2">Felt restless, and perplexed, and compromised:</p>
					<p>He thought Aurora Raby's eyes more bright</p>
					<p class="i2">Than Adeline (such is advice) advised;</p>
					<p>If he had known exactly his own plight,</p>
					<p class="i2">He probably would have philosophised:</p>
					<p>A great resource to all, and ne'er denied</p>
					<p>Till wanted; therefore Juan only sighed.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>He sighed;—the next resource is the full moon,</p>
					<p class="i2">Where all sighs are deposited; and now</p>
					<p>It happened luckily, the chaste orb shone</p>
					<p class="i2">As clear as such a climate will allow;</p>
					<p>And Juan's mind was in the proper tone</p>
					<p class="i2">To hail her with the apostrophe—"O thou!"</p>
					<p>Of amatory egotism the <i>Tuism</i>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_777">[777]</a></p>
					<p>Which further to explain would be a truism.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But Lover, Poet, or Astronomer—</p>
					<p class="i2">Shepherd, or swain—whoever may behold,</p>
					<p>Feel some abstraction when they gaze on her;</p>
					<p class="i2">Great thoughts we catch from thence (besides a cold</p>
					<p>Sometimes, unless my feelings rather err);</p>
					<p class="i2">Deep secrets to her rolling light are told;</p>
					<p>The Ocean's tides and mortals' brains she sways,</p>
					<p>And also hearts—if there be truth in lays.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Juan felt somewhat pensive, and disposed</p>
					<p class="i2">For contemplation rather than his pillow:</p>
					<p>The Gothic chamber, where he was enclosed,</p>
					<p class="i2">Let in the rippling sound of the lake's billow,</p>
					<p>With all the mystery by midnight caused:</p>
					<p class="i2">Below his window waved (of course) willow;</p>
					<p>And he stood gazing out on the cascade</p>
					<p>That flashed and after darkened in the shade.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Upon his table or his toilet,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_778">[778]</a>—<i>which</i></p>
					<p class="i2">Of these is not exactly ascertained,—</p>
					<p>(I state this, for I am cautious to a pitch</p>
					<p class="i2">Of nicety, where a fact is to be gained,)</p>
					<p>A lamp burned high, while he leant from a niche,</p>
					<p class="i2">Where many a Gothic ornament remained,</p>
					<p>In chiselled stone and painted glass, and all</p>
					<p>That Time has left our fathers of their Hall.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Then, as the night was clear though cold, he threw</p>
					<p class="i2">His chamber door wide open<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_779">[779]</a>—and went forth</p>
					<p>Into a gallery of a sombre hue,</p>
					<p class="i2">Long, furnished with old pictures of great worth,</p>
					<p>Of knights and dames heroic and chaste too,</p>
					<p class="i2">As doubtless should be people of high birth;</p>
					<p>But by dim lights the portraits of the dead</p>
					<p>Have something ghastly, desolate, and dread.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The forms of the grim Knight and pictured Saint</p>
					<p class="i2">Look living in the moon; and as you turn</p>
					<p>Backward and forward to the echoes faint</p>
					<p class="i2">Of your own footsteps—voices from the Urn</p>
					<p>Appear to wake, and shadows wild and quaint</p>
					<p class="i2">Start from the frames which fence their aspects stern,</p>
					<p>As if to ask how you can dare to keep</p>
					<p>A vigil there, where all but Death should sleep.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And the pale smile of Beauties in the grave,</p>
					<p class="i2">The charms of other days, in starlight gleams,</p>
					<p>Glimmer on high; their buried locks still wave</p>
					<p class="i2">Along the canvas; their eyes glance like dreams</p>
					<p>On ours, or spars within some dusky cave,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_780">[780]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">But Death is imaged in their shadowy beams.</p>
					<p>A picture is the past; even ere its frame</p>
					<p>Be gilt, who sate hath ceased to be the same.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>As Juan mused on Mutability,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or on his Mistress—terms synonymous—</p>
					<p>No sound except the echo of his sigh</p>
					<p class="i2">Or step ran sadly through that antique house;</p>
					<p>When suddenly he heard, or thought so, nigh,</p>
					<p class="i2">A supernatural agent—or a mouse,</p>
					<p>Whose little nibbling rustle will embarrass</p>
					<p>Most people as it plays along the arras.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>It was no mouse—but lo! a monk, arrayed<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_781">[781]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">In cowl and beads, and dusky garb, appeared,</p>
					<p>Now in the moonlight, and now lapsed in shade,</p>
					<p class="i2">With steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard;</p>
					<p>His garments only a slight murmur made;</p>
					<p class="i2">He moved as shadowy as the Sisters weird,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_782">[782]</a></p>
					<p>But slowly; and as he passed Juan by,</p>
					<p>Glanced, without pausing, on him a bright eye.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Juan was petrified; he had heard a hint</p>
					<p class="i2">Of such a Spirit in these halls of old,</p>
					<p>But thought, like most men, that there was nothing in't</p>
					<p class="i2">Beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,</p>
					<p>Coined from surviving Superstition's mint,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which passes ghosts in currency like gold,</p>
					<p>But rarely seen, like gold compared with paper.</p>
					<p>And did he see this? or was it a vapour?</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Once, twice, thrice passed, repassed—the thing of air,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or earth beneath, or Heaven, or t' other place;</p>
					<p>And Juan gazed upon it with a stare,</p>
					<p class="i2">Yet could not speak or move; but, on its base</p>
					<p>As stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair</p>
					<p class="i2">Twine like a knot of snakes around his face;</p>
					<p>He taxed his tongue for words, which were not granted,</p>
					<p>To ask the reverend person what he wanted.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The third time, after a still longer pause,</p>
					<p class="i2">The shadow passed away—but where? the hall</p>
					<p>Was long, and thus far there was no great cause</p>
					<p class="i2">To think his vanishing unnatural:</p>
					<p>Doors there were many, through which, by the laws</p>
					<p class="i2">Of physics, bodies whether short or tall</p>
					<p>Might come or go; but Juan could not state</p>
					<p>Through which the Spectre seemed to evaporate.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>He stood—how long he knew not, but it seemed</p>
					<p class="i2">An age—expectant, powerless, with his eyes</p>
					<p>Strained on the spot where first the figure gleamed</p>
					<p class="i2">Then by degrees recalled his energies,</p>
					<p>And would have passed the whole off as a dream,</p>
					<p class="i2">But could not wake; he was, he did surmise,</p>
					<p>Waking already, and returned at length</p>
					<p>Back to his chamber, shorn of half his strength.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>All there was as he left it: still his taper</p>
					<p class="i2">Burned, and not <i>blue</i>, as modest tapers use,</p>
					<p>Receiving sprites with sympathetic vapour;</p>
					<p class="i2">He rubbed his eyes, and they did not refuse</p>
					<p>Their office: he took up an old newspaper;</p>
					<p class="i2">The paper was right easy to peruse;</p>
					<p>He read an article the King attacking,</p>
					<p>And a long eulogy of "Patent Blacking."</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>This savoured of this world; but his hand shook:</p>
					<p class="i2">He shut his door, and after having read</p>
					<p>A paragraph, I think about Horne Tooke,</p>
					<p class="i2">Undressed, and rather slowly went to bed.</p>
					<p>There, couched all snugly on his pillow's nook,</p>
					<p class="i2">With what he had seen his phantasy he fed;</p>
					<p>And though it was no opiate, slumber crept</p>
					<p>Upon him by degrees, and so he slept.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>He woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,</p>
					<p class="i2">Pondered upon his visitant or vision,</p>
					<p>And whether it ought not to be disclosed,</p>
					<p class="i2">At risk of being quizzed for superstition.</p>
					<p>The more he thought, the more his mind was posed:</p>
					<p class="i2">In the mean time, his valet, whose precision</p>
					<p>Was great, because his master brooked no less,</p>
					<p>Knocked to inform him it was time to dress.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>He dressed; and like young people he was wont</p>
					<p class="i2">To take some trouble with his toilet, but</p>
					<p>This morning rather spent less time upon't;</p>
					<p class="i2">Aside his very mirror soon was put;</p>
					<p>His curls fell negligently o'er his front,</p>
					<p class="i2">His clothes were not curbed to their usual cut,</p>
					<p>His very neckcloth's Gordian knot was tied</p>
					<p>Almost an hair's breadth too much on one side.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And when he walked down into the Saloon,</p>
					<p class="i2">He sate him pensive o'er a dish of tea,</p>
					<p>Which he perhaps had not discovered soon,</p>
					<p class="i2">Had it not happened scalding hot to be,</p>
					<p>Which made him have recourse unto his spoon;</p>
					<p class="i2">So much <i>distrait</i> he was, that all could see</p>
					<p>That something was the matter—Adeline</p>
					<p>The first—but <i>what</i> she could not well divine.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>She looked, and saw him pale, and turned as pale</p>
					<p class="i2">Herself; then hastily looked down, and muttered</p>
					<p>Something, but what's not stated in my tale.</p>
					<p class="i2">Lord Henry said, his muffin was ill buttered;</p>
					<p>The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke played with her veil,</p>
					<p class="i2">And looked at Juan hard, but nothing uttered.</p>
					<p>Aurora Raby with her large dark eyes</p>
					<p>Surveyed him with a kind of calm surprise.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But seeing him all cold and silent still,</p>
					<p class="i2">And everybody wondering more or less,</p>
					<p>Fair Adeline inquired, "If he were ill?"</p>
					<p class="i2">He started, and said, "Yes—no—rather—yes."</p>
					<p>The family physician had great skill,</p>
					<p class="i2">And being present, now began to express</p>
					<p>His readiness to feel his pulse and tell</p>
					<p>The cause, but Juan said, he was "quite well."</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"Quite well; yes,—no."—These answers were mysterious,</p>
					<p class="i2">And yet his looks appeared to sanction both,</p>
					<p>However they might savour of delirious;</p>
					<p class="i2">Something like illness of a sudden growth</p>
					<p>Weighed on his spirit, though by no means serious:</p>
					<p class="i2">But for the rest, as he himself seemed both</p>
					<p>To state the case, it might be ta'en for granted</p>
					<p>It was not the physician that he wanted.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Lord Henry, who had now discussed his chocolate,</p>
					<p class="i2">Also the muffin whereof he complained,</p>
					<p>Said, Juan had not got his usual look elate,</p>
					<p class="i2">At which he marvelled, since it had not rained;</p>
					<p>Then asked her Grace what news were of the Duke of late?</p>
					<p class="i2"><i>Her</i> Grace replied, <i>his</i> Grace was rather pained</p>
					<p>With some slight, light, hereditary twinges</p>
					<p>Of gout, which rusts aristocratic hinges.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Then Henry turned to Juan, and addressed</p>
					<p class="i2">A few words of condolence on his state:</p>
					<p>"You look," quoth he, "as if you had had your rest</p>
					<p class="i2">Broke in upon by the Black Friar of late."</p>
					<p>"What Friar?" said Juan; and he did his best</p>
					<p class="i2">To put the question with an air sedate,</p>
					<p>Or careless; but the effort was not valid</p>
					<p>To hinder him from growing still more pallid.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"Oh! have you never heard of the Black Friar?</p>
					<p class="i2">The Spirit of these walls?"—"In truth not I."</p>
					<p>"Why Fame—but Fame you know's sometimes a liar—</p>
					<p class="i2">Tells an odd story, of which by and by:</p>
					<p>Whether with time the Spectre has grown shyer,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or that our Sires had a more gifted eye</p>
					<p>For such sights, though the tale is half believed,</p>
					<p>The Friar of late has not been oft perceived.</p>

			<h3>XXXVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"The last time was——"—"I pray," said Adeline—</p>
					<p class="i2">(Who watched the changes of Don Juan's brow,</p>
					<p>And from its context thought she could divine</p>
					<p class="i2">Connections stronger than he chose to avow</p>
					<p>With this same legend)—"if you but design</p>
					<p class="i2">To jest, you'll choose some other theme just now,</p>
					<p>Because the present tale has oft been told,</p>

			<h3>XXXVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">

					<p class="i2">But, come, I'll set your story to a tune."</p>
					<p>Graceful as Dian when she draws her bow,</p>

					<p>Ye powers! it is the—the—the—Pooh! the cat!</p>
					<p class="i2">The Devil may take that stealthy pace of his!</p>
					<p>So like a spiritual pit-a-pat,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or tiptoe of an amatory Miss,</p>
					<p>Gliding the first time to a <i>rendezvous</i>,</p>
					<p>And dreading the chaste echoes of her shoe.</p>

					<p>Again—what is 't? The wind? No, no,—this time</p>

					<p>With awful footsteps regular as rhyme,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or (as rhymes may be in these days) much more.</p>
					<p>Again through shadows of the night sublime,</p>
					<p class="i2">When deep sleep fell on men,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_809">[809]</a> and the World wore</p>
					<p>The starry darkness round her like a girdle</p>
					<p>Spangled with gems—the Monk made his blood curdle.</p>

			<h3>CXIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>A noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_810">[810]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Which sets the teeth on edge; and a slight clatter,</p>
					<p>Like showers which on the midnight gusts will pass,</p>
					<p class="i2">Sounding like very supernatural water,</p>
					<p>Came over Juan's ear, which throbbed, alas!</p>
					<p class="i2">For Immaterialism's a serious matter;</p>
					<p>So that even those whose faith is the most great</p>

					<p>Were his eyes open?—Yes! and his mouth too.</p>
					<p class="i2">Surprise has this effect—to make one dumb,</p>
					<p>Yet leave the gate which Eloquence slips through</p>
					<p class="i2">As wide as if a long speech were to come.</p>
					<p>Nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew,</p>
					<p class="i2">Tremendous to a mortal tympanum:</p>
					<p>His eyes were open, and (as was before</p>
					<p>Stated) his mouth. What opened next?—the door.</p>

			<h3>CXVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">

					<p>The door flew wide, not swiftly,—but, as fly</p>
					<p class="i2">The sea-gulls, with a steady, sober flight—</p>
					<p>And then swung back; nor close—but stood awry,</p>
					<p class="i2">Half letting in long shadows on the light,</p>
					<p>Which still in Juan's candlesticks burned high,</p>
					<p class="i2">For he had two, both tolerably bright,</p>
					<p>And in the doorway, darkening darkness, stood</p>
					<p>The sable Friar in his solemn hood.</p>

					<p>Don Juan shook, as erst he had been shaken</p>
					<p class="i2">The night before; but being sick of shaking,</p>
					<p>He first inclined to think he had been mistaken;</p>
					<p class="i2">And then to be ashamed of such mistaking;</p>
					<p>His own internal ghost began to awaken</p>
					<p class="i2">Within him, and to quell his corporal quaking—</p>
					<p>Hinting that Soul and Body on the whole</p>
					<p>Were odds against a disembodied Soul.</p>

			<h3>CXIX.</h3>

					<p>And then his dread grew wrath, and his wrath fierce,</p>
					<p class="i2">And he arose, advanced—the Shade retreated;</p>
					<p>But Juan, eager now the truth to pierce,</p>
					<p class="i2">Followed, his veins no longer cold, but heated,</p>
					<p>Resolved to thrust the mystery <i>carte</i> and <i>tierce</i>,</p>
					<p class="i2">At whatsoever risk of being defeated:</p>
					<p>The Ghost stopped, menaced, then retired, until</p>
					<p>He reached the ancient wall, then stood stone still.</p>

					<p>Juan put forth one arm—Eternal powers!</p>
					<p class="i2">It touched no soul, nor body, but the wall,</p>
					<p>On which the moonbeams fell in silvery showers,</p>
					<p class="i2">Chequered with all the tracery of the Hall;</p>
					<p>He shuddered, as no doubt the bravest cowers</p>
					<p class="i2">When he can't tell what 'tis that doth appal.</p>
					<p>How odd, a single hobgoblin's nonentity</p>
					<p>Should cause more fear than a whole host's identity!</p>

			<h3>CXXI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But still the Shade remained: the blue eyes glared,</p>
					<p class="i2">And rather variably for stony death;</p>
					<p>Yet one thing rather good the grave had spared,</p>
					<p class="i2">The Ghost had a remarkably sweet breath:</p>
					<p>A straggling curl showed he had been fair-haired;</p>
					<p class="i2">A red lip, with two rows of pearls beneath,</p>
					<p>Gleamed forth, as through the casement's ivy shroud</p>
					<p>The Moon peeped, just escaped from a grey cloud.</p>

					<p>And Juan, puzzled, but still curious, thrust</p>
					<p class="i2">His other arm forth—Wonder upon wonder!</p>
					<p>It pressed upon a hard but glowing bust,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which beat as if there was a warm heart under.</p>
					<p>He found, as people on most trials must,</p>
					<p class="i2">That he had made at first a silly blunder,</p>
					<p>And that in his confusion he had caught</p>
					<p>Only the wall, instead of what he sought.</p>

					<p>The Ghost, if Ghost it were, seemed a sweet soul</p>

					<p class="i2">Forth into something much like flesh and blood;</p>
					<p>Back fell the sable frock and dreary cowl,</p>
					<p class="i2">And they revealed—alas! that e'er they should!</p>
					<p>In full, voluptuous, but <i>not o'er</i>grown bulk,</p>
