			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>When amatory poets sing their loves</p>
					<p class="i2">In liquid lines mellifluously bland,</p>
					<p>And pair their rhymes as Venus yokes her doves,</p>
					<p class="i2">They little think what mischief is in hand;</p>
					<p>The greater their success the worse it proves,</p>
					<p class="i2">As Ovid's verse may give to understand;</p>
					<p>Even Petrarch's self, if judged with due severity,</p>
					<p>Is the Platonic pimp of all posterity.</p>

			<h3>II.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I therefore do denounce all amorous writing,</p>
					<p class="i2">Except in such a way as not to attract;</p>
					<p>Plain—simple—short, and by no means inviting,</p>
					<p class="i2">But with a moral to each error tacked,</p>
					<p>Formed rather for instructing than delighting,</p>
					<p class="i2">And with all passions in their turn attacked;</p>
					<p>Now, if my Pegasus should not be shod ill,</p>
					<p>This poem will become a moral model.</p>

			<h3>III.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The European with the Asian shore</p>
					<p class="i2">Sprinkled with palaces—the Ocean stream<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_271">[271]</a></p>
					<p>Here and there studded with a seventy-four,</p>
					<p class="i2">Sophia's Cupola with golden gleam,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_272">[272]</a></p>
					<p>The cypress groves, Olympus high and hoar,</p>
					<p class="i2">The twelve isles, and the more than I could dream,</p>
					<p>Far less describe, present the very view</p>
					<p>Which charmed the charming Mary Montagu.</p>

			<h3>IV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I have a passion for the name of "Mary,"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_273">[273]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">For once it was a magic sound to me;</p>
					<p>And still it half calls up the realms of Fairy,</p>
					<p class="i2">Where I beheld what never was to be;</p>
					<p>All feelings changed, but this was last to vary,</p>
					<p class="i2">A spell from which even yet I am not quite free:</p>
					<p>But I grow sad—and let a tale grow cold,</p>
					<p>Which must not be pathetically told.</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The wind swept down the Euxine, and the wave</p>

					<p>'T is a grand sight from off "the Giant's Grave"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_274">[274]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">To watch the progress of those rolling seas</p>
					<p>Between the Bosphorus, as they lash and lave</p>
					<p class="i2">Europe and Asia, you being quite at ease:</p>
					<p>There's not a sea the passenger e'er pukes in,</p>
					<p>Turns up more dangerous breakers than the Euxine.</p>

			<h3>VI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>'T was a raw day of Autumn's bleak beginning,</p>
					<p class="i2">When nights are equal, but not so the days;</p>
					<p>The Parcæ then cut short the further spinning</p>
					<p class="i2">Of seamen's fates, and the loud tempests raise<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_ET">[ET]</a></p>
					<p>The waters, and repentance for past sinning</p>
					<p class="i2">In all, who o'er the great deep take their ways:</p>
					<p>They vow to amend their lives, and yet they don't;</p>
					<p>Because if drowned, they can't—if spared, they won't.</p>

			<h3>VII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>A crowd of shivering slaves of every nation,</p>
					<p class="i2">And age, and sex, were in the market ranged;</p>
					<p>Each bevy with the merchant in his station:</p>
					<p class="i2">Poor creatures! their good looks were sadly changed.</p>
					<p>All save the blacks seemed jaded with vexation,</p>
					<p class="i2">From friends, and home, and freedom far estranged;</p>
					<p>The negroes more philosophy displayed,—</p>
					<p>Used to it, no doubt, as eels are to be flayed.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Juan was juvenile, and thus was full,</p>
					<p class="i2">As most at his age are, of hope, and health;</p>
					<p>Yet I must own, he looked a little dull,</p>
					<p class="i2">And now and then a tear stole down by stealth;</p>
					<p>Perhaps his recent loss of blood might pull</p>
					<p class="i2">His spirit down; and then the loss of wealth,</p>
					<p>A mistress, and such comfortable quarters,</p>
					<p>To be put up for auction amongst Tartars,</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Were things to shake a Stoic; ne'ertheless,</p>
					<p class="i2">Upon the whole his carriage was serene:</p>
					<p>His figure, and the splendour of his dress,</p>
					<p class="i2">Of which some gilded remnants still were seen,</p>
					<p>Drew all eyes on him, giving them to guess</p>
					<p class="i2">He was above the vulgar by his mien;</p>
					<p>And then, though pale, he was so very handsome;</p>
					<p>And then—they calculated on his ransom.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_EU">[EU]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>X.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Like a backgammon board the place was dotted</p>
					<p class="i2">With whites and blacks, in groups on show for sale,</p>
					<p>Though rather more irregularly spotted:</p>
					<p class="i2">Some bought the jet, while others chose the pale.</p>
					<p>It chanced amongst the other people lotted,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_EV">[EV]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">A man of thirty, rather stout and hale,</p>
					<p>With resolution in his dark grey eye,</p>
					<p>Next Juan stood, till some might choose to buy.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>He had an English look; that is, was square</p>
					<p class="i2">In make, of a complexion white and ruddy,</p>
					<p>Good teeth, with curling rather dark brown hair,</p>
					<p class="i2">And, it might be from thought, or toil, or study,</p>
					<p>An open brow a little marked with care:</p>
					<p class="i2">One arm had on a bandage rather bloody;</p>
					<p>And there he stood with such <i>sang froid,</i> that greater</p>
					<p>Could scarce be shown even by a mere spectator.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But seeing at his elbow a mere lad,</p>
					<p class="i2">Of a high spirit evidently, though</p>
					<p>At present weighed down by a doom which had</p>
					<p class="i2">O'erthrown even men, he soon began to show</p>
					<p>A kind of blunt compassion for the sad</p>
					<p class="i2">Lot of so young a partner in the woe,</p>
					<p>Which for himself he seemed to deem no worse</p>
					<p>Than any other scrape, a thing of course.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"My boy!"—said he, "amidst this motley crew</p>
					<p class="i2">Of Georgians, Russians, Nubians, and what not,</p>
					<p>All ragamuffins differing but in hue,</p>
					<p class="i2">With whom it is our luck to cast our lot,</p>
					<p>The only gentlemen seem I and you;</p>
					<p class="i2">So let us be acquainted, as we ought:</p>

			</div>
			<h3>XIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>When Juan answered—"Spanish!" he replied,</p>
					<p class="i2">"I thought, in fact, you could not be a Greek;</p>
					<p>Those servile dogs are not so proudly eyed:</p>
					<p class="i2">Fortune has played you here a pretty freak,</p>
					<p>But that's her way with all men, till they're tried;</p>
					<p class="i2">But never mind,—she'll turn, perhaps, next week;</p>
					<p>She has served me also much the same as you,</p>
					<p>Except that I have found it nothing new."</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"Pray, sir," said Juan, "if I may presume,</p>
					<p class="i2"><i>What</i> brought you here?"—"Oh! nothing very rare—</p>
					<p>Six Tartars and a drag-chain——"—"To this doom</p>
					<p class="i2">But what conducted, if the question 's fair,</p>
					<p>Is that which I would learn."—"I served for some</p>
					<p class="i2">Months with the Russian army here and there;</p>
					<p>And taking lately, by Suwarrow's bidding,</p>
					<p>A town, was ta'en myself instead of Widdin."<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_275">[275]</a></p>

			<h3>XVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"Have you no friends?"—"I had—but, by God's blessing,</p>
					<p class="i2">Have not been troubled with them lately. Now</p>
					<p>I have answered all your questions without pressing,</p>
					<p class="i2">And you an equal courtesy should show."</p>
					<p>"Alas!" said Juan, "'t were a tale distressing,</p>
					<p class="i2">And long besides."—"Oh! if 't is really so,</p>
					<p>You're right on both accounts to hold your tongue;</p>
					<p>A sad tale saddens doubly when 't is long.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"But droop not: Fortune at your time of life,</p>
					<p class="i2">Although a female moderately fickle,</p>
					<p>Will hardly leave you (as she's not your wife)</p>
					<p class="i2">For any length of days in such a pickle.</p>
					<p>To strive, too, with our fate were such a strife</p>
					<p class="i2">As if the corn-sheaf should oppose the sickle:</p>
					<p>Men are the sport of circumstances, when</p>
					<p>The circumstances seem the sport of men."</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"'T is not," said Juan, "for my present doom</p>
					<p class="i2">I mourn, but for the past;—I loved a maid:"—</p>
					<p>He paused, and his dark eye grew full of gloom;</p>
					<p class="i2">A single tear upon his eyelash staid</p>
					<p>A moment, and then dropped; "but to resume,</p>
					<p class="i2">'Tis not my present lot, as I have said,</p>
					<p>Which I deplore so much; for I have borne</p>
					<p>Hardships which have the hardiest overworn,</p>

			<h3>XIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"On the rough deep. But this last blow—" and here</p>
					<p class="i2">He stopped again, and turned away his face.</p>
					<p>"Aye," quoth his friend, "I thought it would appear</p>
					<p class="i2">That there had been a lady in the case;</p>
					<p>And these are things which ask a tender tear,</p>
					<p class="i2">Such as I, too, would shed if in your place:</p>
					<p>I cried upon my first wife's dying day,</p>
					<p>And also when my second ran away:</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"My third——"—"Your third!" quoth Juan, turning round;</p>
					<p class="i2">"You scarcely can be thirty: have you three?"</p>
					<p>"No—only two at present above ground:</p>
					<p class="i2">Surely 't is nothing wonderful to see</p>
					<p>One person thrice in holy wedlock bound!"</p>
					<p class="i2">"Well, then, your third," said Juan; "what did she?</p>
					<p>She did not run away, too,—did she, sir?"</p>
					<p>"No, faith."—"What then?"—"I ran away from her."</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"You take things coolly, sir," said Juan. "Why,"</p>
					<p class="i2">Replied the other, "what can a man do?</p>
					<p>There still are many rainbows in your sky,</p>
					<p class="i2">But mine have vanished. All, when Life is new,</p>
					<p>Commence with feelings warm, and prospects high;</p>
					<p class="i2">But Time strips our illusions of their hue,</p>
					<p>And one by one in turn, some grand mistake</p>
					<p>Casts off its bright skin yearly like the snake.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"'T is true, it gets another bright and fresh,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or fresher, brighter; but the year gone through,</p>
					<p>This skin must go the way, too, of all flesh,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or sometimes only wear a week or two;—</p>
					<p>Love's the first net which spreads its deadly mesh;</p>
					<p class="i2">Ambition, Avarice, Vengeance, Glory, glue</p>
					<p>The glittering lime-twigs of our latter days,</p>
					<p>Where still we flutter on for pence or praise."</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"All this is very fine, and may be true,"</p>
					<p class="i2">Said Juan; "but I really don't see how</p>
					<p>It betters present times with me or you."</p>
					<p class="i2">"No?" quoth the other; "yet you will allow</p>
					<p>By setting things in their right point of view,</p>
					<p class="i2">Knowledge, at least, is gained; for instance, now,</p>
					<p>We know what slavery is, and our disasters</p>
					<p>May teach us better to behave when masters."</p>

			</div>
			<h3>XXIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"Would we were masters now, if but to try</p>
					<p class="i2">Their present lessons on our Pagan friends here,"</p>

					<p class="i2">"Heaven help the scholar, whom his fortune sends here!"</p>
					<p>"Perhaps we shall be one day, by and by,"</p>
					<p class="i2">Rejoined the other, "when our bad luck mends here;</p>
					<p>Meantime (yon old black eunuch seems to eye us)</p>

			<h3>XXV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"But after all, what <i>is</i> our present state?</p>
					<p class="i2">'T is bad, and may be better—all men's lot:</p>
					<p>Most men are slaves, none more so than the great,</p>
					<p class="i2">To their own whims and passions, and what not;</p>
					<p>Society itself, which should create</p>
					<p class="i2">Kindness, destroys what little we had got:</p>
					<p>To feel for none is the true social art</p>
					<p>Of the world's Stoics—men without a heart."</p>

			</div>
			<h3>XXVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Just now a black old neutral personage</p>
					<p class="i2">Of the third sex stepped up, and peering over</p>
					<p>The captives seemed to mark their looks and age,</p>
					<p class="i2">And capabilities, as to discover</p>
					<p>If they were fitted for the purposed cage:</p>
					<p class="i2">No lady e'er is ogled by a lover,</p>
					<p>Horse by a blackleg, broadcloth by a tailor,</p>
					<p>Fee by a counsel, felon by a jailor,</p>

				<div class="stanza">
					<p>As is a slave by his intended bidder.</p>
					<p class="i2">'T is pleasant purchasing our fellow-creatures;</p>

					<p class="i2">Their passions, and are dext'rous; some by features</p>
					<p>Are bought up, others by a warlike leader,</p>
					<p class="i2">Some by a place—as tend their years or natures:</p>
					<p>The most by ready cash—but all have prices,</p>

			<h3>XXVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The eunuch, having eyed them o'er with care,</p>
					<p class="i2">Turned to the merchant, and began to bid</p>
					<p>First but for one, and after for the pair;</p>
					<p class="i2">They haggled, wrangled, swore, too—so they did!</p>
					<p>As though they were in a mere Christian fair,</p>

					<p>At last they settled into simple grumbling,</p>

					<p class="i2">Until the sum was accurately scanned,</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I wonder if his appetite was good?</p>
					<p class="i2">Or, if it were, if also his digestion?</p>

					<p class="i2">And Conscience ask a curious sort of question,</p>
					<p>About the right divine how far we should</p>

					<p>His Highness cast around his great black eyes,</p>
					<p class="i2">And looking, as he always looked, perceived</p>
					<p>Juan amongst the damsels in disguise,</p>
					<p class="i2">At which he seemed no whit surprised nor grieved,</p>
					<p>But just remarked with air sedate and wise,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_FY">[FY]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">While still a fluttering sigh Gulbeyaz heaved,</p>

					<p>This compliment, which drew all eyes upon</p>

					<p>Her comrades, also, thought themselves undone:</p>

					<p>Such notice of a giaour, while scarce to one</p>
					<p class="i2">Of them his lips imperial ever spake!</p>

					<p>Their chastity in these unhappy climes<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_FZ">[FZ]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Is not a thing of that astringent quality</p>
					<p>Which in the North prevents precocious crimes,</p>

					<p>Spoilt, as a pipe of claret is when pricked:</p>
