					<p>Ah!—What should follow slips from my reflection;</p>
					<p class="i2">Whatever follows ne'ertheless may be</p>
					<p>As à-propos of Hope or Retrospection,</p>
					<p class="i2">As though the lurking thought had followed free.</p>
					<p>All present life is but an Interjection,</p>
					<p class="i2">An "Oh!" or "Ah!" of Joy or Misery,</p>
					<p>Or a "Ha! ha!" or "Bah!"—a yawn, or "Pooh!"</p>
					<p>Of which perhaps the latter is most true.</p>

					<p>But, more or less, the whole's a Syncopé</p>

					<p class="i2">Wherewith we break our bubbles on the Ocean—</p>
					<p>That Watery Outline of Eternity,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or miniature, at least, as is my notion—</p>

					<p>But all are better than the sigh suppressed,</p>

					<p>Making the countenance a masque of rest<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_NI">[NI]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">And turning Human Nature to an art.</p>
					<p>Few men dare show their thoughts of worst or best;</p>

					<p>A corner for herself; and, therefore, Fiction</p>

					<p>There's Music in the sighing of a reed;</p>

			<h3>VI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The Lady Adeline, Right Honourable,</p>

					<p>They differ as wine differs from its label,</p>
					<p class="i2">When once decanted;—I presume to guess so,</p>

					<p class="i2">Or glorious as a diamond richly set;</p>
					<p>A page where Time should hesitate to print age,</p>
					<p class="i2">And for which Nature might forego her debt—<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_NJ">[NJ]</a></p>
					<p>Sole creditor whose process doth involve in't</p>

					<p>O Death! thou dunnest of all duns! thou daily</p>

					<p>Like a meek tradesman when approaching palely</p>
					<p class="i2">Some splendid debtor he would take by sap:</p>
					<p>But oft denied, as Patience 'gins to fail, he</p>
					<p class="i2">Advances with exasperated rap,</p>
					<p>And (if let in) insists, in terms unhandsome,</p>
					<p>On ready money, or "a draft on Ransom."<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_734">[734]</a></p>

					<p>Whate'er thou takest, spare awhile poor Beauty!</p>
					<p class="i2">She is so rare, and thou hast so much prey.</p>
					<p>What though she now and then may slip from duty,</p>
					<p class="i2">The more's the reason why you ought to stay;</p>
					<p>Gaunt Gourmand! with whole nations for your booty,—<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_NK">[NK]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">You should be civil in a modest way:</p>

					<p>Fair Adeline, the more ingenuous</p>
					<p class="i2">Where she was interested (as was said),</p>

					<p class="i2">To like too readily, or too high bred</p>
					<p>To show it—(points we need not now discuss)—</p>
					<p class="i2">Would give up artlessly both Heart and Head</p>
					<p>Unto such feelings as seemed innocent,</p>
					<p>For objects worthy of the sentiment.</p>

			<h3>XI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Some parts of Juan's history, which Rumour,</p>
					<p class="i2">That live Gazette, had scattered to disfigure,</p>
					<p>She had heard; but Women hear with more good humour</p>
					<p class="i2">Such aberrations than we men of rigour:</p>
					<p>Besides, his conduct, since in England, grew more</p>
					<p class="i2">Strict, and his mind assumed a manlier vigour:</p>
					<p>Because he had, like Alcibiades,</p>
					<p>The art of living in all climes with ease.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_735">[735]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>His manner was perhaps the more seductive,</p>
					<p class="i2">Because he ne'er seemed anxious to seduce;</p>
					<p>Nothing affected, studied, or constructive</p>
					<p class="i2">Of coxcombry or conquest: no abuse</p>
					<p>Of his attractions marred the fair perspective,</p>
					<p class="i2">To indicate a Cupidon broke loose,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_736">[736]</a></p>
					<p>And seem to say, "Resist us if you can"—</p>
					<p>Which makes a Dandy while it spoils a Man.</p>

			</div>
			<h3>XIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>They are wrong—that's not the way to set about it;</p>
					<p class="i2">As, if they told the truth, could well be shown.</p>
					<p>But, right or wrong, Don Juan was without it;</p>
					<p class="i2">In fact, his manner was his own alone:</p>
					<p>Sincere he was—at least you could not doubt it,</p>
					<p class="i2">In listening merely to his voice's tone.</p>
					<p>The Devil hath not in all his quiver's choice</p>
					<p>An arrow for the Heart like a sweet voice.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>By nature soft, his whole address held off</p>
					<p class="i2">Suspicion: though not timid, his regard</p>
					<p>Was such as rather seemed to keep aloof,</p>
					<p class="i2">To shield himself than put <i>you</i> on your guard:</p>
					<p>Perhaps 't was hardly quite assured enough,</p>
					<p class="i2">But Modesty's at times its own reward,</p>
					<p>Like Virtue; and the absence of pretension</p>
					<p>Will go much farther than there's need to mention.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Serene, accomplished, cheerful but not loud;</p>
					<p class="i2">Insinuating without insinuation;</p>
					<p>Observant of the foibles of the crowd,</p>
					<p class="i2">Yet ne'er betraying this in conversation;</p>
					<p>Proud with the proud, yet courteously proud,</p>
					<p class="i2">So as to make them feel he knew his station</p>
					<p>And theirs:—without a struggle for priority,</p>
					<p>He neither brooked nor claimed superiority—</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>That is, with Men: with Women he was what</p>
					<p class="i2">They pleased to make or take him for; and their</p>
					<p>Imagination's quite enough for that:</p>
					<p class="i2">So that the outline's tolerably fair,</p>
					<p>They fill the canvas up—and <i>"verbum sat."</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_737">[737]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">If once their phantasies be brought to bear</p>
					<p>Upon an object, whether sad or playful,</p>
					<p>They can transfigure brighter than a Raphael.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_738">[738]</a></p>

			<h3>XVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Adeline, no deep judge of character,</p>
					<p class="i2">Was apt to add a colouring from her own:</p>
					<p>'T is thus the Good will amiably err,</p>
					<p class="i2">And eke the Wise, as has been often shown.</p>
					<p>Experience is the chief philosopher,</p>
					<p class="i2">But saddest when his science is well known:</p>
					<p>And persecuted Sages teach the Schools</p>
					<p>Their folly in forgetting there are fools.</p>

					<p>Was it not so, great Locke? and greater Bacon?</p>

					<p>Whose lot it is by Man to be mistaken,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_NL">[NL]</a></p>

					<p>Redeeming Worlds to be by bigots shaken,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_NM">[NM]</a></p>

			<h3>XIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I perch upon an humbler promontory,</p>

					<p>With no great care for what is nicknamed Glory,</p>
					<p class="i2">But speculating as I cast mine eye</p>
					<p>On what may suit or may not suit my story,</p>
					<p class="i2">And never straining hard to versify,</p>

				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I don't know that there may be much ability</p>

					<p>But there's a conversational facility,</p>
					<p class="i2">Which may round off an hour upon a time.</p>
					<p>Of this I'm sure at least, there's no servility</p>
					<p class="i2">In mine irregularity of chime,</p>
					<p>Which rings what's uppermost of new or hoary,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_NN">[NN]</a></p>

					<p>The first is rather more than mortal can do;</p>

					<p>The third is still more difficult to stand to;</p>
