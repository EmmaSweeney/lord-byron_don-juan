			<h3>I.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Oh ye! who teach the ingenuous youth of nations,</p>
					<p class="i2">Holland, France, England, Germany, or Spain,</p>
					<p>I pray ye flog them upon all occasions—</p>
					<p class="i2">It mends their morals, never mind the pain:</p>
					<p>The best of mothers and of educations</p>
					<p class="i2">In Juan's case were but employed in vain,</p>
					<p>Since, in a way that's rather of the oddest, he</p>
					<p>Became divested of his native modesty.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_AY">[AY]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>II.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Had he but been placed at a public school,</p>
					<p class="i2">In the third form, or even in the fourth,</p>
					<p>His daily task had kept his fancy cool,</p>
					<p class="i2">At least, had he been nurtured in the North;</p>
					<p>Spain may prove an exception to the rule,</p>
					<p class="i2">But then exceptions always prove its worth—</p>
					<p>A lad of sixteen causing a divorce</p>
					<p>Puzzled his tutors very much, of course.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>III.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I can't say that it puzzles me at all,</p>
					<p class="i2">If all things be considered: first, there was</p>
					<p>His lady-mother, mathematical,</p>
					<p class="i2">A——never mind;—his tutor, an old ass;</p>
					<p>A pretty woman—(that's quite natural,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or else the thing had hardly come to pass)</p>
					<p>A husband rather old, not much in unity</p>
					<p>With his young wife—a time, and opportunity.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Well—well; the World must turn upon its axis,</p>
					<p class="i2">And all Mankind turn with it, heads or tails,</p>
					<p>And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,</p>
					<p class="i2">And as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails;</p>
					<p>The King commands us, and the Doctor quacks us,</p>
					<p class="i2">The Priest instructs, and so our life exhales,</p>
					<p>A little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,</p>
					<p>Fighting, devotion, dust,—perhaps a name.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>V.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz—</p>
					<p class="i2">A pretty town, I recollect it well—</p>
					<p>'T is there the mart of the colonial trade is,</p>
					<p class="i2">(Or was, before Peru learned to rebel),</p>
					<p>And such sweet girls!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_97">[97]</a>—I mean, such graceful ladies,</p>
					<p class="i2">Their very walk would make your bosom swell;</p>
					<p>I can't describe it, though so much it strike,</p>
					<p>Nor liken it—I never saw the like:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_AZ">[AZ]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>An Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb</p>
					<p class="i2">New broke, a camelopard, a gazelle,</p>
					<p>No—none of these will do;—and then their garb,</p>
					<p class="i2">Their veil and petticoat—Alas! to dwell</p>
					<p>Upon such things would very near absorb</p>
					<p class="i2">A canto—then their feet and ankles,—well,</p>
					<p>Thank Heaven I've got no metaphor quite ready,</p>
					<p>(And so, my sober Muse—come, let's be steady—</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Chaste Muse!—well,—if you must, you must)—the veil</p>
					<p class="i2">Thrown back a moment with the glancing hand,</p>
					<p>While the o'erpowering eye, that turns you pale,</p>
					<p class="i2">Flashes into the heart:—All sunny land</p>
					<p>Of Love! when I forget you, may I fail</p>
					<p class="i2">To——say my prayers—but never was there planned</p>
					<p>A dress through which the eyes give such a volley,</p>
					<p>Excepting the Venetian Fazzioli.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_98">[98]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>VIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But to our tale: the Donna Inez sent</p>
					<p class="i2">Her son to Cadiz only to embark;</p>
					<p>To stay there had not answered her intent,</p>
					<p class="i2">But why?—we leave the reader in the dark—</p>
					<p>'T was for a voyage the young man was meant,</p>
					<p class="i2">As if a Spanish ship were Noah's ark,</p>
					<p>To wean him from the wickedness of earth,</p>
					<p>And send him like a Dove of Promise forth.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>IX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Don Juan bade his valet pack his things</p>
					<p class="i2">According to direction, then received</p>
					<p>A lecture and some money: for four springs</p>
					<p class="i2">He was to travel; and though Inez grieved</p>
					<p>(As every kind of parting has its stings),</p>
					<p class="i2">She hoped he would improve—perhaps believed:</p>
					<p>A letter, too, she gave (he never read it)</p>
					<p>Of good advice—and two or three of credit.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>X.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>In the mean time, to pass her hours away,</p>
					<p class="i2">Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school</p>
					<p>For naughty children, who would rather play</p>
					<p class="i2">(Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;</p>
					<p>Infants of three years old were taught that day,</p>
					<p class="i2">Dunces were whipped, or set upon a stool:</p>
					<p>The great success of Juan's education</p>
					<p>Spurred her to teach another generation.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_BA">[BA]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Juan embarked—the ship got under way,</p>
					<p class="i2">The wind was fair, the water passing rough;</p>
					<p>A devil of a sea rolls in that bay,</p>
					<p class="i2">As I, who've crossed it oft, know well enough;</p>
					<p>And, standing on the deck, the dashing spray</p>
					<p class="i2">Flies in one's face, and makes it weather-tough:</p>
					<p>And there he stood to take, and take again,</p>
					<p>His first—perhaps his last—farewell of Spain.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>I can't but say it is an awkward sight</p>
					<p class="i2">To see one's native land receding through</p>
					<p>The growing waters; it unmans one quite,</p>
					<p class="i2">Especially when life is rather new:</p>
					<p>I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_99">[99]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">But almost every other country's blue,</p>
					<p>When gazing on them, mystified by distance,</p>
					<p>We enter on our nautical existence.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>So Juan stood, bewildered on the deck:</p>
					<p class="i2">The wind sung, cordage strained, and sailors swore,</p>
					<p>And the ship creaked, the town became a speck,</p>
					<p class="i2">From which away so fair and fast they bore.</p>
					<p>The best of remedies is a beef-steak</p>
					<p class="i2">Against sea-sickness: try it, Sir, before</p>
					<p>You sneer, and I assure you this is true,</p>
					<p>For I have found it answer—so may you.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Don Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,</p>
					<p class="i2">Beheld his native Spain receding far:</p>
					<p>First partings form a lesson hard to learn,</p>
					<p class="i2">Even nations feel this when they go to war;</p>
					<p>There is a sort of unexpressed concern,</p>
					<p class="i2">A kind of shock that sets one's heart ajar,</p>
					<p>At leaving even the most unpleasant people</p>
					<p>And places—one keeps looking at the steeple.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But Juan had got many things to leave,</p>
					<p class="i2">His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,</p>
					<p>So that he had much better cause to grieve</p>
					<p class="i2">Than many persons more advanced in life:</p>
					<p>And if we now and then a sigh must heave</p>
					<p class="i2">At quitting even those we quit in strife,</p>
					<p>No doubt we weep for those the heart endears—</p>
					<p>That is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>So Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews</p>
					<p class="i2">By Babel's waters, still remembering Sion:</p>
					<p>I'd weep,—but mine is not a weeping Muse,</p>
					<p class="i2">And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;</p>
					<p>Young men should travel, if but to amuse</p>
					<p class="i2">Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on</p>
					<p>Behind their carriages their new portmanteau,</p>
					<p>Perhaps it may be lined with this my canto.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>And Juan wept, and much he sighed and thought,</p>
					<p class="i2">While his salt tears dropped into the salt sea,</p>
					<p>"Sweets to the sweet;" (I like so much to quote;</p>
					<p class="i2">You must excuse this extract,—'t is where she,</p>
					<p>The Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought</p>
					<p class="i2">Flowers to the grave;) and, sobbing often, he</p>
					<p>Reflected on his present situation,</p>
					<p>And seriously resolved on reformation.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!" he cried,</p>
					<p class="i2">"Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,</p>
					<p>But die, as many an exiled heart hath died,</p>
					<p class="i2">Of its own thirst to see again thy shore:</p>
					<p>Farewell, where Guadalquivir's waters glide!</p>
					<p class="i2">Farewell, my mother! and, since all is o'er,</p>
					<p>Farewell, too, dearest Julia!—(here he drew</p>
					<p>Her letter out again, and read it through.)</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"And oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear—</p>
					<p class="i2">But that's impossible, and cannot be—</p>
					<p>Sooner shall this blue Ocean melt to air,</p>
					<p class="i2">Sooner shall Earth resolve itself to sea,</p>
					<p>Than I resign thine image, oh, my fair!</p>
					<p class="i2">Or think of anything, excepting thee;</p>
					<p>A mind diseased no remedy can physic—</p>
					<p>(Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick.)</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"Sooner shall Heaven kiss earth—(here he fell sicker)</p>
					<p class="i2">Oh, Julia! what is every other woe?—</p>
					<p>(For God's sake let me have a glass of liquor;</p>
					<p class="i2">Pedro, Battista, help me down below.)</p>
					<p>Julia, my love!—(you rascal, Pedro, quicker)—</p>
					<p class="i2">Oh, Julia!—(this curst vessel pitches so)—</p>
					<p>Belovéd Julia, hear me still beseeching!"</p>
					<p>(Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,</p>
					<p class="i2">Or rather stomach, which, alas! attends,</p>
					<p>Beyond the best apothecary's art,</p>
					<p class="i2">The loss of Love, the treachery of friends,</p>
					<p>Or death of those we dote on, when a part</p>
					<p class="i2">Of us dies with them as each fond hope ends:</p>
					<p>No doubt he would have been much more pathetic,</p>
					<p>But the sea acted as a strong emetic.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Love's a capricious power: I've known it hold</p>
					<p class="i2">Out through a fever caused by its own heat,</p>
					<p>But be much puzzled by a cough and cold,</p>
					<p class="i2">And find a quinsy very hard to treat;</p>
					<p>Against all noble maladies he's bold,</p>
					<p class="i2">But vulgar illnesses don't like to meet,</p>
					<p>Nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,</p>
					<p>Nor inflammations redden his blind eye.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But worst of all is nausea, or a pain</p>
					<p class="i2">About the lower region of the bowels;</p>
					<p>Love, who heroically breathes a vein,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_100">[100]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Shrinks from the application of hot towels,</p>
					<p>And purgatives are dangerous to his reign,</p>
					<p class="i2">Sea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_BB">[BB]</a></p>
					<p>Could Juan's passion, while the billows roar,</p>
					<p>Resist his stomach, ne'er at sea before?</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The ship, called the most holy "Trinidada,"<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_101">[101]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Was steering duly for the port Leghorn;</p>
					<p>For there the Spanish family Moncada</p>
					<p class="i2">Were settled long ere Juan's sire was born:</p>
					<p>They were relations, and for them he had a</p>
					<p class="i2">Letter of introduction, which the morn</p>
					<p>Of his departure had been sent him by</p>
					<p>His Spanish friends for those in Italy.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>His suite consisted of three servants and</p>
					<p class="i2">A tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,</p>
					<p>Who several languages did understand,</p>
					<p class="i2">But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow</p>
					<p>And, rocking in his hammock, longed for land,</p>
					<p class="i2">His headache being increased by every billow;</p>
					<p>And the waves oozing through the port-hole made</p>
					<p>His berth a little damp, and him afraid.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>'T was not without some reason, for the wind</p>
					<p class="i2">Increased at night, until it blew a gale;</p>
					<p>And though 't was not much to a naval mind,</p>
					<p class="i2">Some landsmen would have looked a little pale,</p>
					<p>For sailors are, in fact, a different kind:</p>
					<p class="i2">At sunset they began to take in sail,</p>
					<p>For the sky showed it would come on to blow,</p>
					<p>And carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>At one o'clock the wind with sudden shift</p>
					<p class="i2">Threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,</p>
					<p>Which struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,</p>
					<p class="i2">Started the stern-post, also shattered the</p>
					<p>Whole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift</p>
					<p class="i2">Herself from out her present jeopardy,</p>
					<p>The rudder tore away: 't was time to sound</p>
					<p>The pumps, and there were four feet water found.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>One gang of people instantly was put</p>
					<p class="i2">Upon the pumps, and the remainder set</p>
					<p>To get up part of the cargo, and what not;</p>
					<p class="i2">But they could not come at the leak as yet;</p>
					<p>At last they did get at it really, but</p>
					<p class="i2">Still their salvation was an even bet:</p>
					<p>The water rushed through in a way quite puzzling,</p>
					<p>While they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Into the opening; but all such ingredients</p>
					<p class="i2">Would have been vain, and they must have gone down,</p>
					<p>Despite of all their efforts and expedients,</p>
					<p class="i2">But for the pumps: I'm glad to make them known</p>
					<p>To all the brother tars who may have need hence,</p>
					<p class="i2">For fifty tons of water were upthrown</p>
					<p>By them per hour, and they had all been undone,</p>
					<p>But for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_102">[102]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>As day advanced the weather seemed to abate,</p>
					<p class="i2">And then the leak they reckoned to reduce,</p>
					<p>And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet</p>
					<p class="i2">Kept two hand—and one chain-pump still in use.</p>
					<p>The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late</p>
					<p class="i2">A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,</p>
					<p>A gust—which all descriptive power transcends—</p>
					<p>Laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>There she lay, motionless, and seemed upset;</p>
					<p class="i2">The water left the hold, and washed the decks,</p>
					<p>And made a scene men do not soon forget;</p>
					<p class="i2">For they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,</p>
					<p>Or any other thing that brings regret</p>
					<p class="i2">Or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:</p>
					<p>Thus drownings are much talked of by the divers,</p>
					<p>And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Immediately the masts were cut away,</p>
					<p class="i2">Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,</p>
					<p>The main-mast followed: but the ship still lay</p>
					<p class="i2">Like a mere log, and baffled our intent.</p>
					<p>Foremast and bowsprit were cut down, and they</p>
					<p class="i2">Eased her at last (although we never meant</p>
					<p>To part with all till every hope was blighted),</p>
					<p>And then with violence the old ship righted.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_103">[103]</a></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>It may be easily supposed, while this</p>
					<p class="i2">Was going on, some people were unquiet,</p>
					<p>That passengers would find it much amiss</p>
					<p class="i2">To lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;</p>
					<p>That even the able seaman, deeming his</p>
					<p class="i2">Days nearly o'er, might be disposed to riot,</p>
					<p>As upon such occasions tars will ask</p>
					<p>For grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXIV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>There's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms</p>
					<p class="i2">As rum and true religion: thus it was,</p>
					<p>Some plundered, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,</p>
					<p class="i2">The high wind made the treble, and as bass</p>
					<p>The hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms</p>
					<p class="i2">Of all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:</p>
					<p>Strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,</p>
					<p>Clamoured in chorus to the roaring Ocean.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXV.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>Perhaps more mischief had been done, but for<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_BC">[BC]</a></p>
					<p class="i2">Our Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,</p>
					<p>Got to the spirit-room, and stood before</p>
					<p class="i2">It with a pair of pistols;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_104">[104]</a> and their fears,</p>
					<p>As if Death were more dreadful by his door</p>
					<p class="i2">Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,</p>
					<p>Kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,</p>
					<p>Thought it would be becoming to die drunk.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXVI.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>"Give us more grog," they cried, "for it will be</p>
					<p class="i2">All one an hour hence." Juan answered, "No!</p>
					<p>'T is true that Death awaits both you and me,</p>
					<p class="i2">But let us die like men, not sink below</p>
					<p>Like brutes:"—and thus his dangerous post kept he,</p>
					<p class="i2">And none liked to anticipate the blow;</p>
					<p>And even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,</p>
					<p>Was for some rum a disappointed suitor.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXVII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>The good old gentleman was quite aghast,</p>
					<p class="i2">And made a loud and pious lamentation;</p>
					<p>Repented all his sins, and made a last</p>
					<p class="i2">Irrevocable vow of reformation;</p>
					<p>Nothing should tempt him more (this peril past)</p>
					<p class="i2">To quit his academic occupation,</p>
					<p>In cloisters of the classic Salamanca,</p>
					<p>To follow Juan's wake, like Sancho Panca.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXVIII.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>But now there came a flash of hope once more;</p>
					<p class="i2">Day broke, and the wind lulled: the masts were gone</p>
					<p>The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,</p>
					<p class="i2">The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_105">[105]</a></p>
					<p>They tried the pumps again, and though before</p>
					<p class="i2">Their desperate efforts seemed all useless grown,</p>
					<p>A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale—</p>
					<p>The stronger pumped, the weaker thrummed a sail.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>XXXIX.</h3>
			<div class="poem">
